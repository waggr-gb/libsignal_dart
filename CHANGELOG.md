## [Unreleased]

## [8.0.0] - 2026-09-28 (waggr-gb fork; native crate libsignal_frb 7.0.0)

### Fork

- **This is the waggr-gb fork of `djx-y-z/libsignal_dart`** — see `FORK.md`.
  `hook/build.dart` downloads native binaries from
  `waggr-gb/libsignal_dart` releases, and the package is never published to
  pub.dev (`publish_to: none`).
- **Breaking: every Rust API error is a `LibSignalException { code, message }`**
  instead of a bare `String`, so callers branch on a stable `code` rather than
  matching message text (upstream issue
  [djx-y-z/libsignal_dart#106](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/106)).
  The crate API changed, so the native crate moves to 7.0.0.


### For Users

#### Added

- **`KyberKeyPair.fromKeys()` rebuilds a Kyber key pair from its two halves**
  ([#103](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/103))
  (`rust/src/api/kyber.rs`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, `README.md`) —
  `KyberPreKeyRecord.create` takes a `KyberKeyPair`, and the only ways to get
  one were `KyberKeyPair.generate()`, or `getKeyPair()` and `cloneKey()` on a
  record or pair already held. An application that stores the public and
  secret keys apart — each has its own `serialize()` — therefore had no way
  back from those bytes to a record through the API. The EC records never had
  this gap: `PreKeyRecord` and `SignedPreKeyRecord` take their public and
  private keys separately. Signal's own bindings share it — none of them builds
  a key pair from its two halves — so this is an addition on our side,
  performing the same join libsignal does when it reads a stored Kyber record
  back.

  There is still no serialized form of the pair itself, and that is deliberate:
  upstream defines none, and a format this package invented would be one it had
  to keep reading forever. The halves' own encodings are the format. A pre-key
  kept whole needs none of this — `KyberPreKeyRecord.serialize()` carries both
  halves together with the id, timestamp and signature.

  `fromKeys()` also checks that the halves belong together, which upstream does
  not: its key pair compares only the key types. The check encapsulates a
  shared secret to the public key, decapsulates it under the secret key and
  compares the two in constant time. That is the pair-wise consistency test
  FIPS 203 (§7.1) and FIPS 140-3 IG 10.3.A define for ML-KEM, applied to
  round-3 Kyber by analogy rather than by requirement — and only that step, not
  FIPS 203's full key-pair check. Nothing later would catch a mismatch: creating
  a record and reading it back do not check the pairing, and Kyber
  decapsulation does not fail under the wrong key — it returns a different
  secret. A mixed-up record would be accepted and published, and the mismatch
  would surface only when a peer's first message failed to decrypt. Observed
  rather than inferred: a record whose secret key is not the partner of the
  published public key makes that first message fail with a bare
  `invalid PreKey message: decryption failed`, naming no key, and
  `test/kyber/kyber_key_pair_test.dart` pins that it fails to decrypt, next to a
  record rebuilt through `fromKeys()` that succeeds. The test stores a foreign
  pair rather than mixed halves; to the recipient the two are the same case,
  since it reads only the record's secret key. It follows that every session
  started against a mixed-up last-resort key would fail until the key was
  rotated.

  Unlike `IdentityKeyPair.fromKeys`, it borrows its arguments instead of moving
  them, so both handles stay usable after the call, whether or not the check
  passes. The pair holds its own copy of the secret key: `dispose()` the
  `KyberSecretKey` you passed in once you are done with it. `subtle`, already in
  the dependency graph through libsignal, is now a direct dependency for the
  comparison. The README's key table gains a `KyberKeyPair` row.

#### Fixed

- **The example app reports why it failed to start instead of spinning
  forever** (`example/lib/main.dart`) — `_initLibSignal()` is fire-and-forget
  from `initState()` and caught nothing, so any `LibSignal.init()` failure left
  the initialized flag false and the progress indicator running, with the
  exception visible only in the console. The body now branches three ways and
  renders the error, the raw message included, plus a hint that names the
  usual web cause and `make run-example-web`.

  It is the same failure a consumer meets. On web `init()` throws when
  `web/pkg/` was never provisioned, and the most common way to reach that is
  documented under *Known Limitations*: `flutter run -d chrome` after a run for
  another platform reuses that run's `dart_build` stamp — the build directory
  key does not include the target platform — and skips the build hook outright.
  A spinner says none of that.

- **A local WASM build left over from an older crate version is no longer
  served silently** (`hook/build.dart`, `Makefile`) — the web path of the build
  hook prefers a local `rust/target/wasm32/` build over the released module,
  and it took that directory on the sole condition that the two files *exist*.
  It then recorded `local-dev` in `web/pkg/.wasm-version` rather than a
  version, so the staleness check that guards the download path — added in
  6.1.0 for exactly this failure — was unreachable on the local one. A wasm
  module built before a crate bump was therefore copied into `web/pkg/` and
  served, announced by nothing louder than `Using local WASM build from …`.

  Measured in this repository rather than reasoned about: after the 6.3.1
  release, `rust/target/wasm32/` still held a module built on 2026-09-08, when
  the crate was 6.3.0 and the vendored libsignal was v0.102.0. A web build
  would have run that module against a package whose native side is v0.103.0 —
  that is, without the two hardenings 7.3.1 is about.

  ⚠ **`rustContentHash` cannot catch this**, which is the reason the fix is a
  version stamp rather than a reuse of the existing check. That value compares
  the FFI *surface*, and the surface was byte-identical across 6.3.0 → 6.3.1 —
  precisely why that release was a patch. The one value already crossing the
  Dart-to-binary boundary is blind to this case by construction. Timestamps are
  no better: a checkout or a stash moves them in either direction without the
  content changing.

  `make build-web` now stamps the crate version into
  `rust/target/wasm32/.crate-version`, and the hook refuses a local build whose
  stamp is missing or disagrees with `rust/Cargo.toml`, naming the command that
  fixes it. A directory built before this release carries no stamp and is
  rejected, which is the intended answer rather than an accident.

  **Who this reaches:** `rust/target/` is `.pubignore`d and absent from the
  published archive, so a consumer installing from pub.dev never takes this
  path. It affects work in this repository and anyone depending on it by path
  or git who has run `make build-web`. It was also latent rather than active —
  `make run-example-web` depends on `build-web`, so the module is rebuilt
  before every run through it; the exposed routes are `flutter build web` and a
  hand-run `flutter run -d chrome`.

### For Contributors

#### Changed

- **copier template adopted: v4.14.0 → v4.14.1** (`.copier-answers.yml`) — the
  adoption moved `_commit` and nothing else, and that is the finding rather
  than an absence of one: of the release's four commits, the two that reach a
  generated project were both written here first. The action pins
  (`anthropics/claude-code-action` v1.0.222 → v1.0.228,
  `android-actions/setup-android` v4.0.1 → v4.0.4) arrived as Dependabot's
  grouped bump `f58bbcc`, and the local-WASM version stamp is the `#### Fixed`
  entry above, `9f0c86c`. The other two commits — moving the template's *own*
  release workflow to `actions/checkout@v7`, and the release preparation —
  live at the template root rather than under `template/`, so they reach no
  generated project at all.

  Three files conflicted, `Makefile`, `hook/build.dart` and
  `test/hook/build_hook_test.dart`, and all three resolved to ours on wording
  alone: our comments name the vendored *crypto* and the concrete 6.3.0 →
  6.3.1 that motivated the stamp where the template generalises to "native
  code" and "a patch release", and our tests assert against the real crate
  versions where the template's skeleton uses `1.5.0` / `1.4.0`. The mechanical
  check that guards a keep-ours resolution — resolve every block to ours, then
  diff against `HEAD` — came back empty on all three, so nothing the template
  had merged cleanly outside the conflict brackets was discarded.

  One thing was checked by hand because no gate can report it.
  `.github/agent-prompts/changelog-scope.md` is `_skip_if_exists`, so a
  template change to it can never arrive: its absence from a change list is a
  dropped change rather than an identical one. It did not move in this range.

## [7.3.1] - 2026-09-20

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **libsignal v0.103.0** — two upstream hardenings reach the protocol this
  package exposes: a peer can no longer turn post-quantum ratcheting off by
  presenting an SPQR version this client does not support, and a repeated
  pre-key message that carries a different identity key is rejected instead of
  being accepted into the session that is already established
- **libsignal_frb v6.3.1** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **libsignal moves to v0.103.0** (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — fourteen commits
  upstream ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.102.3...v0.103.0)).
  Upstream's own notes for the tag list five items, and the one that reaches
  this package is the first of them — the SPQR update, which is under
  **Security** below.

  The other four do not reach it. The WebAuthn registration flow, the
  `OneTimePasswordNotVerified` → `MfaNotVerified` rename, the two MFA
  verification APIs and key transparency over gRPC all land in `rust/net`,
  twenty of the range's seventy-two files, and `libsignal-net` appears nowhere
  in `rust/Cargo.lock` — not directly and not transitively. The `{webp,mp4}san`
  0.5.4 upgrade changes no file under `rust/media` at all; it is a
  `[workspace.dependencies]` bump, and `mp4san`, `webpsan` and
  `mediasan-common` are absent from the lockfile too. Thirty-two more files are
  the Swift, Java and Node bindings and nine are `rust/bridge`, the C FFI
  surface those bindings compile against, which this package does not use — it
  binds the pure-Rust crates directly. The rest are upstream's own
  `acknowledgments/`, its podspec, and the notes, manifest and lockfile its
  release commit touches.

  Of the four crates from that repository in this package's dependency graph,
  the complete file list touches two files. `rust/core/src/version.rs` is the
  version string. `rust/protocol/src/protocol.rs` drops a `log::warn!` that
  printed both MACs when a `SignalMessage` MAC check failed; the constant-time
  comparison itself is unchanged, and this package installs no `log`
  implementation, so those records already went nowhere here and nothing
  observable changes. No source file under `signal-crypto` is listed, and the
  file list does not join either change to a named commit. Upstream's workspace
  `rust-version` stays at 1.93.1, so the build floor does not move.
  `make codegen` produced no change under `lib/src/rust/`, so the FFI surface
  did not move — and, as with v0.102.3, that is not the same as "nothing
  reaches the surface".

  Asked at the lockfile rather than the file tree, the transitive half appears,
  and that is where this release's one user-visible change lives: `spqr` moves
  1.5.3 → 1.6.0 and drops `curve25519-dalek` and `displaydoc` from its runtime
  dependencies, keeping the former as a dev-dependency. Six registry crates
  move — `cc`, `cfg-if`, `find-msvc-tools`, `rustix`, `syn` and
  `unicode-ident` — and none is added or removed. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`
  records the moves that are not test-only.
- **libsignal moves to v0.102.3** (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — ten commits upstream
  ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.102.2...v0.102.3)).
  Upstream's own notes for the tag name only the four new `AuthKeysService`
  pre-key APIs, and the one change in this range that does reach this package is
  not among them — it is under **Security** below.

  Of the four crates from that repository in this package's dependency graph,
  the range touches two source files beyond the version string, and they come
  from **different** commits. `rust/protocol/src/session.rs`, with its test
  `rust/protocol/tests/session.rs`, is `08b7ba68`, the stricter pre-key
  validation. `rust/protocol/src/state/prekey.rs` is `2a569601`, one of the
  `AuthKeysService` commits, and all it does there is add `#[repr(transparent)]`
  to `PreKeyId(u32)` — a memory-layout attribute, which changes no behaviour, no
  serialization and nothing this package exposes.

  The `AuthKeysService` work itself lands in `rust/net/chat` and `rust/net/grpc`,
  crates outside this package's dependency graph, and its Swift, Java and Node
  halves land in the upstream bridge and language-binding directories, which this
  package does not use — it binds the pure-Rust crates directly.
  `rust/core/src/version.rs` changes only the version string, and no source file
  under `signal-crypto` is listed. Upstream's workspace `rust-version` stays at
  1.93.1, so the build floor does not move. `make codegen` produced no change
  under `lib/src/rust/`, so the FFI surface did not move — but this time that is
  not the same as "nothing reaches the surface", because the behaviour behind an
  unchanged signature did change.
- **libsignal moves to v0.102.2, and again nothing it changed is reachable from
  here** (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — nine commits upstream
  ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.102.1...v0.102.2)).
  Upstream's own notes for the tag name three of them: SVR production moving
  to 2026Q3, and two backup validations — the `sharedName` field on `Contact`
  together with `aci`, `nickname` and `note` on `ContactAttachment`, and the
  `sharedName` option in `LearnedProfileChatUpdate.previousName`. The first is
  in `rust/net` and the other two in `rust/message-backup`, and neither
  `libsignal-net` nor `libsignal-message-backup` appears in `rust/Cargo.lock`
  at all — not as a direct dependency and not transitively.

  The five the notes do not mention land in the same two places or in the
  bridge. Removing the `send_raw_grpc` endpoints, adding a per-wrapper
  `LOG_TAG` and dropping the unused UDP DNS stub resolver are `rust/net`; the
  Gaussian padding calculations are `rust/message-backup`, and also add a
  `rand_distr` entry to the upstream workspace, which this package does not
  resolve. The `export_name` syntax change is in `rust/bridge`, as are the
  bridge halves of the `send_raw_grpc` removal and the padding change — that is
  the C FFI surface the Swift, Java and Node bindings compile against, which
  this package does not use: it binds the pure-Rust crates directly. The ninth
  commit is upstream's own `Reset for version v0.102.2`.

  Four crates from that repository do reach the graph: `libsignal-protocol`,
  `libsignal-core` and `signal-crypto`, which this package names, and
  `libsignal-debug`, which arrives transitively. Between them the range changes
  exactly one file — `rust/core/src/version.rs`, the version string.
  Regenerating the bindings produced no change under `lib/src/rust/`, so these
  changes do not affect this library's public API. Upstream's workspace
  `rust-version` stays at 1.93.1, so the build floor does not move either.
- **libsignal moves to v0.102.1, and nothing it changed is reachable from here**
  (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — five commits upstream ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.102.0...v0.102.1)),
  and upstream's own release notes carry a single line: "Allow unknown chunks in
  webp sanitization". That relaxation is in `rust/media/src/sanitize/webp.rs`,
  and `libsignal-media` is not in this package's dependency graph. The other
  three land the same way and for the same reason: the `SignalType_` typedef
  rename is in `rust/bridge/shared/types`, the C FFI surface the Swift, Java and
  Node bindings compile against, which this package does not use — it binds the
  pure-Rust crates directly — and the two tinyvec commits drop a
  `>=1.11.0, <1.13.0` workspace cap and a dev-dependency in `rust/net/infra`,
  neither of which is a crate this package resolves.

  Four crates from that repository do reach the graph: `libsignal-protocol`,
  `libsignal-core` and `signal-crypto`, which this package names, and
  `libsignal-debug`, which arrives transitively. Between them the range changes
  exactly one file — `rust/core/src/version.rs`, the version string. So the
  weaker claim is the true one and the stronger one is not: they are not
  unchanged, but nothing they changed reaches the surface this package exposes.
  Regenerating the bindings produced no change under `lib/src/rust/`; the FFI
  surface did not move. Upstream's workspace `rust-version` stays at 1.93.1, so
  the build floor does not move either.

  Asked at the lockfile rather than the file tree, the answer holds:
  `rust/Cargo.lock` carries 226 packages before and after, with **none added and
  none removed**. Beside the four retagged libsignal crates, twenty registry
  versions move, and eleven of them put code in a shipped artifact — `aes`
  0.9.2 → 0.9.3 under `aes-gcm-siv`, `zerocopy` 0.8.56 → 0.8.57 under
  `libsignal-core`, `indexmap` 2.14.1 → 2.14.2 under `libsignal-protocol`,
  `hybrid-array` under `block-buffer`, the three `crossbeam` crates under
  `rayon-core`, and, in the WASM module only, `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.127 → 0.2.128
  with `js-sys`, `web-sys` and `wasm-bindgen-futures`. The remaining nine are
  proc-macro or test-only. `minicov` moves **backwards**, 0.3.9 → 0.3.8, which
  is not a resolver regression: `wasm-bindgen-test` 0.3.78 tightened its
  requirement from `^0.3.8` to `=0.3.8`, and it is a dev-dependency that reaches
  no artifact. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` records the seventeen moves that are
  not test-only

#### Security

- **A peer can no longer turn off post-quantum ratcheting by presenting an
  unsupported SPQR version** — upstream v0.103.0 moves `spqr`, the sparse
  post-quantum ratchet, from 1.5.3 to 1.6.0. It is not a direct dependency and
  no symbol in `lib/` or `rust/src/api/` names it, but it runs inside the
  Double Ratchet this package exposes: `rust/protocol/src/triple_ratchet.rs`
  mixes the key it returns into every message key, and
  `test/protocol/spqr_ratchet_progress_test.dart` exercises it through the
  ordinary encrypt/decrypt path.

  libsignal creates every session — both `initialize_alice_session` and
  `initialize_bob_session` — with `min_version: spqr::Version::V1`, commented
  "Require that all clients speak SPQR". Under 1.5.3 that floor was not
  consulted on the path that mattered. A message whose leading version byte was
  not a version the client recognised returned `Ok` with the state unchanged
  and **no key**, and a missing post-quantum key means the message keys are
  derived from the classical chain alone. A peer could therefore opt the
  session out of post-quantum ratcheting on its own, by presenting a version
  number from the future. 1.6.0 checks the floor first, for every message, and
  a version the client does not share is either answered with real chain-key
  material or refused outright — never ignored. A refusal surfaces here as
  `InvalidMessage` carrying "post-quantum ratchet error".

  **The wire format did not change**, which is worth stating because a change
  to this crate normally would. `spqr`'s encoder is byte-identical between the
  two tags — `version || varint(epoch) || varint(index) || type || chunk` — and
  the epoch cadence and chain parameters are untouched. What moved is the
  decoder: version, epoch and index are now parsed ahead of the
  version-specific body, so a message from a *higher* SPQR version can still be
  read far enough to return the epoch-0 chain key for its index, where 1.5.3
  could return nothing usable. Sessions between two clients on this release are
  unaffected, and so is compatibility with clients on the previous one.

  **What a caller may see:** a decrypt from a peer presenting an SPQR version
  this client does not support now either derives proper post-quantum material
  or throws, where it used to succeed with none mixed in. No signature changed
  and no caller has to change code.
- **A repeated pre-key message carrying a different identity key is now
  rejected** — upstream `08b7ba68`, reached from here through
  `messageDecryptPrekeyWithCallbacks` and `sealedSenderDecryptWithCallbacks`,
  both exported from `libsignal.dart`. When a pre-key message arrives for a
  session that is already established, libsignal used to read it as a replay and
  return early, accepting it into that session whatever identity key it carried;
  a mismatch surfaced later at the MAC check, if it surfaced at all. It now
  compares the message's identity key against the one stored for the session —
  a constant-time comparison, upstream notes, as long as the two keys are of the
  same type — and returns `InvalidMessage` with "remote identity key not
  consistent with previously-established session" straight away.

  **What a caller may see:** a decrypt that previously failed later, differently,
  or not at all can now throw at this point instead. No signature changed and no
  caller has to change code, so this is not breaking; but a caller that branches
  on error text rather than catching the exception should know the message is
  new. Upstream's release notes for v0.102.3 do not mention this change.

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **The repair agent can reach the branch it has to repair**
  (`.github/workflows/repair-build.yml`,
  `.github/agent-prompts/repair-build.md`,
  `.github/agent-config/opencode.json`) — `repair-build.yml` watched `main` and
  nothing else, and the failure this package actually gets is the one that can
  never appear there. When an `update-libsignal-*` pull request pins a version
  whose API has changed shape, the required checks fail, so it never merges, so
  `main` stays green and the workflow sees nothing. It has happened three times
  — `bc081c7` (v0.87.0, `IdentityKey` lost its comparison), `4a28ea8` (v0.93.1,
  two functions gained `local_address`) and `fc80c5b` (v0.94.0, `verify_mac` →
  `verify_mac_with_addresses`) — each fixed by hand.

  The workflow gains a second mode rather than a wider trigger: it takes the
  head of a red bot pull request as its base and lands the repair as a commit on
  that branch, signed, through `createCommitOnBranch`. Most of those never reach
  a model — 31 pull requests here have carried `codegen-failed` and 3 were
  genuine API changes, so the job runs `make codegen` first and asks a model only
  when the generator itself fails against the new pin.

  Two checks were added that a model cannot argue with, and the first closes a
  hole this repository has already fallen into. The generated files are
  **regenerated after the agent and refused if they move** — the one pull request
  this workflow ever opened (#67) made a red build green by hand-editing
  `lib/src/rust/frb_generated.dart`, which compiled, passed the tests, and was
  caught by the AI reviewer rather than by anything deterministic. The same run
  explains why: the repair job never installed `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`, so
  `make codegen` exited 127 and hand-editing was the only move left. It installs
  it now. Second, whether this package's own Dart API moved is **measured** from
  the generated bindings rather than taken from the agent's account of it;
  replayed against the three commits above, the measurement separates the one
  that was not breaking from the two that were.

  That measurement is what the boundary rests on: a value available in scope is
  repaired silently, a value that exists only at the caller means the public API
  widens, which is breaking and not an agent's decision. There the whole change
  is prepared and the pull request is labelled `needs-decision` — the version
  number stays where it belongs. Two of the three historical cases land there,
  and structurally: `local_name`/`local_device_id` are parameters of our own FRB
  functions arriving from Dart, and no store callback supplies a local address.

#### Changed

- **copier template adopted: v4.12.0 → v4.14.0** (`.copier-answers.yml`,
  `Makefile`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `.github/workflows/build-libsignal.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/test-reusable.yml`, `scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`,
  new `scripts/verify_release_artifacts.py` and
  `scripts/verify_library_loads.py`) — two releases, and v4.13.0 is only half
  of one: every commit in it was written in this repository first, so its
  adoption moved `_commit` and nothing else, landed as `0471f7a`, and was never
  written up. This entry covers both.

  Three gates arrive. `make rust-clippy-web` lints the wasm32 half of the crate
  and blocks on the Linux x86_64 leg — `make rust-clippy` runs under the host
  target, and a `cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")` body is a *different
  implementation* of the same function rather than the same code on another
  host, so the host pass reads none of its lines while its green reads as if it
  had. The other two first run at the next stage 1.
  `verify_release_artifacts.py` refuses a release archive that does not hold
  what its name says; it reads the libc in ELF `DT_NEEDED` and the platform in
  Mach-O `LC_BUILD_VERSION` rather than calling `file`, because a Linux and an
  Android arm64 `.so` share an ELF header and a macOS, an iOS and an
  iOS-simulator `.dylib` share a Mach-O cputype — exactly the pairs a
  copy-paste slip in the workflow's hand-written `tar` list produces. It runs as
  a job placed **before** `create-release`, so a wrong build is caught without
  spending a reviewer's approval on it, and again over the packed archives
  before the provenance attestation, since a signed attestation for a mispacked
  archive is a mispacked archive that is harder to argue with.
  `verify_library_loads.py` loads the library each build job just produced and
  looks up `frb_init_frb_dart_api_dl`, on the legs whose runner matches the
  target; that covers the one failure every other check here is blind to — a
  library that compiles, packs, checksums and attests, and then does not load.

  Both release gates were measured here before adoption rather than left to
  prove themselves during a release: run against the published
  `libsignal_frb-6.3.0` archives they report green on all twelve platforms, and
  the loader was additionally given a negative control — a Linux `.so` on
  macOS, which it refuses — so its green is known to mean something.

  `insertChangelogEntry` also stops filing a `#### Changed` it has to create
  *above* an existing `#### Added`. It anchors on the first `#### ` heading
  under `### For Users`, and only `#### Changed (Breaking)` was excluded from
  anchoring — but `#### Added` precedes it in the documented order too, and so
  silently took later entries above itself. The exclusion is now a named
  predicate, `precedesChanged`, and the order `CLAUDE.md` documents gains the
  two subsections it was missing, `#### Added` and `#### Documentation`.

  Two things the template offered were **not** taken. It rewrites the released
  `## [1.0.0]` section from `### Added` to `### For Users` / `#### Added`:
  released sections are immutable, and three further sections of that vintage
  carry the same old shape, so normalizing one of the four would have edited
  history in order to make this file *less* consistent. And it adds a paragraph
  describing the audience split to the changelog preamble — which this file
  does not have, which is why the paragraph merged into the middle of the
  history instead. `CLAUDE.md` already documents the split.

- **copier template adopted: v4.9.0 → v4.12.0** (`.copier-answers.yml`,
  `.claude/skills/frb-patterns/SKILL.md`, `.github/rulesets/README.md`, new
  `.github/workflows/refresh-notices.yml`) — three template releases in one
  pass, and taking them separately was not an option: v4.10.0 required the whole
  CI matrix in a generated project and, in doing so, made every cargo pull
  request unmergeable, while v4.11.0 is the repair.

  `refresh-notices.yml` regenerates `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` on Dependabot's
  cargo pull requests. Dependabot edits `rust/Cargo.toml` and `rust/Cargo.lock`
  with no way to run `make third-party-notices` afterwards, so its pull requests
  always arrive carrying a stale inventory — cosmetic while nothing depended on
  it, a hard block once `verify-third-party-notices` sat inside a required
  context. The `.github/rulesets/README.md` paragraph records why the Dependabot
  branch exclusions cannot simply be narrowed: that workflow pushes an ordinary
  **unsigned** commit to those branches, which is legal only because
  `required_signatures` does not reach them. And `SKILL.md` gains a section
  saying that `rust/src/api/` is the directory codegen scans, so a helper that
  exists only to serve the bridge — a test double, a wrapper that records what
  an upstream call did — belongs at the crate root instead; what decides is
  whether the module is reachable from the `rust_input` root, not whether it
  sits in the folder.

  One file the template offers was deliberately **not** taken:
  `.github/rulesets/protect-main.json`. This repository's required-contexts list
  is its own — eleven contexts, with the ARM64 leg excluded as flaky — and
  adopting the template's copy would have rewritten the live ruleset. That is
  why the adoption is four files rather than five, and why the bot's own pull
  request for it was closed rather than merged.

#### Fixed

- **The Android CI legs stopped asking the SDK for a package Google deleted**
  (`.github/workflows/test-reusable.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/build-libsignal.yml`) — all three
  `test / Cross-compile (Android …)` jobs went red at once on 2026-09-15 with
  no change on this side, and because they are required contexts, `main` was
  red and nothing was mergeable.

  `android-actions/setup-android` takes a `packages:` input whose default is
  `tools platform-tools`. `tools` is the legacy SDK Tools package, obsoleted by
  `cmdline-tools` years ago and now absent from `repository2-3.xml`, Google's
  own index, while `platform-tools` is still in it. The action asks for it
  regardless, `sdkmanager` exits 1, and the action fails before the job reaches
  a step of its own — the `sdkmanager --install "ndk;…"` below it never ran,
  which is why the failure looked nothing like a build error. Upstream had no
  fixed release: v4.0.1 is the latest and `android-actions/setup-android#537`,
  opened the same day, is filed against exactly this. Passing
  `packages: platform-tools` drops the dead name and nothing else.

  Both call sites moved together, and that is the point rather than tidiness:
  `build-libsignal.yml` runs the same action, so the next `libsignal_frb-*` tag
  would have failed its Android matrix the same way — after the tag was pushed,
  which is the expensive moment to find out.

- **Three defects in the automated CHANGELOG entry, every one of them fixed in
  code rather than in the prompt** (`scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`,
  `test/scripts/update_changelog_test.dart`) — the v0.102.2 update pull request
  arrived with a doubled list marker, a false statement about upstream, and a
  second Highlights line contradicting the first. All three are decidable from
  the text or from one extra request, which is the same reasoning
  `noImpactPhrase` already carries.

  `insertChangelogEntry` writes the Highlights line as `'- $nativeHighlight'`,
  and the model returned one carrying its own marker, so the entry read
  `- - **libsignal v0.102.2**` — in GFM a nested list under an empty parent
  bullet. Neither side is at fault: rule 1 of the highlight rules gives that
  line without a marker, and four lines above it the current CHANGELOG is pasted
  under "match this house style exactly", where every Highlights line begins
  with one. `stripLeadingListMarker` normalises the answer and a third highlight
  rule states where the marker comes from. Worth recording how this shipped
  green — all five `insertChangelogEntry` tests fed an already-clean string, so
  the suite could not have caught it.

  The entry then opened "upstream has no published release notes". libsignal
  publishes every GitHub release with an empty body, which is all
  `_fetchReleaseNotes` read, so the prompt was handed a placeholder and the
  model reported that absence as a fact about the release — for a tag whose own
  `RELEASE_NOTES.md` named three changes. The fetch now falls back to that file,
  whose first line must name the tag: upstream overwrites it each release, so a
  tag whose release commit missed it would return the previous release's notes,
  wrong rather than missing. A seventh prompt rule closes the rest of the case —
  the sections above the prompt are its inputs, their state is a fact about the
  fetch and never about the release, and an entry must not narrate it.

  Third, Highlights lines accumulated: `[Unreleased]` named v0.102.1 and
  v0.102.2 at once. That line states which upstream version the section ships,
  one per release section, and since dependency bumps now accumulate on `main`
  between releases the second bump in a window meets the first one's line. The
  new line supersedes the old — but only when the old one is the prompt's own
  mandated default, now a shared constant read by both the rule and the check.
  A rewritten line is never touched: those run onto continuation lines, so a
  line match would strand them as a dangling paragraph. When one is left
  standing the section does name two versions, so that case warns instead of
  passing silently.

  That left one cause standing, and it was the one behind the other two faults
  in the same entry — the weak verdict where a checkable claim was available,
  and the Gaussian-padding commit filed under `rust/net` when it landed in
  `rust/message-backup` and `rust/bridge`. A commit subject names a change and
  not a place, and subject lines were all the prompt had. **The compare API's
  file list is now fed to it**, at no extra cost: `files` and `commits` arrive
  in the same payload, and the fetch was already discarding half of it.

  The list carries a header saying whether it is COMPLETE, and that is the part
  that had to be designed rather than the list. The entry rests on a negative
  claim — the crates we bind changed only this file — which is sound only from
  an exhaustive list, and the API caps `files` at 300 while saying so nowhere
  in the payload. So completeness is decided in code, where the counts are, and
  stated in the words the model reads: COMPLETE licenses reasoning from
  absence, TRUNCATED withdraws it. Replayed against the range that produced the
  bad entry, the header reads `COMPLETE … (71)` and the only line in the bound
  crates is `modified rust/core/src/version.rs` — the claim a human had to
  write by hand.

  Still open: the `rust/Cargo.lock` diff, which the prompt also never sees
  though `make rust-update` runs before the changelog step. Same family,
  smaller payoff.
- **The same automated entry then mis-attributed a file, and this one is fixed
  in the prompt rather than in code** (`scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`) —
  feeding the file list bought a real improvement and opened a new way to be
  wrong. The v0.102.3 entry read the list correctly and then guessed which
  commit had changed what.

  That range holds ten commits. `08b7ba68` ("be stricter for pre-key messages
  that change identity keys") touches `rust/protocol/src/session.rs`;
  `2a569601` ("Expose AuthKeysService.setOneTimeEcPreKeys") touches
  `rust/protocol/src/state/prekey.rs`. Both files sit in a bound crate, the list
  names both, and nothing in the material says which commit brought which. The
  entry paired the second file with the first subject, concluded the stricter
  validation reached serialization, and reported as fact something no commit
  did: that file's entire change is `#[repr(transparent)]` on `PreKeyId(u32)`, a
  memory-layout attribute.

  The compare payload is flat by construction — `commits[]` carries no files and
  `files[]` carries no commits — so the prompt now says exactly that and forbids
  attribution outright: name what the range changed, never which commit changed
  it, and where the reason matters, say the data does not carry it. Per-commit
  requests would turn attribution into data; they were considered and deferred,
  because one request per commit is the expensive half and earns nothing if
  stating the gap is enough. A cap on commit count was considered and rejected
  outright — it withdraws the attribution data exactly when a range is large,
  which is when attribution is hardest. The next update pull request measures
  whether the prompt rule suffices.

  Rule 4 gained a second precondition at the same time, for a contradiction in
  that same entry: it said the change reaches the exposed X3DH path and closed
  with "these changes do not affect this library's public API". Both cannot
  hold. `breakingContradictsNoImpact` stayed quiet because it keys on
  `**BREAKING:**`, which the entry never wrote. The phrase is now false by
  construction in two checkable cases — when a COMPLETE file list shows a bound
  crate's source changing, source meaning a file that is neither a version
  string nor a test, and when the only ground offered is an unchanged FFI
  surface, because an unchanged signature is not unchanged behaviour. v0.102.3 was precisely that: same signature, a
  call that can now throw where it used to return. This one stays in the prompt
  rather than joining the code checks for a reason worth recording — deciding it
  in code needs a crate-name-to-path mapping the script does not hold
  (`changelog-scope.md` names crates, not paths), and a check keyed on a line no
  existing scope file carries would pass silently for every project that has
  one.
- **The scope file was asserting as fact the one thing it should have asked to
  be checked** (`.github/agent-prompts/changelog-scope.md`) — the v0.103.0
  entry arrived claiming the update "can change its wire bytes and the number of
  messages in an epoch". It cannot: `spqr`'s encoder is byte-identical between
  1.5.3 and 1.6.0, and the entry missed the security hardening that was the
  release's one user-visible change.

  The model did not invent that sentence. This file carried it, unconditionally
  — "a change to it changes the bytes on the wire and the number of messages an
  epoch takes" — as a standing property of any `spqr` change, and the model
  restated it, hedged to "can". So this is the third distinct source of a bad
  entry in as many bumps, after the prompt and the flat file list, and the only
  one that lives in the project's own material rather than in the template's.

  What makes the premise unverifiable from the prompt's inputs is worth
  recording, because no enrichment of the libsignal compare would fix it:
  **`spqr` is a different repository.** A bump leaves exactly one trace in the
  material the prompt is given — a version number in a manifest — and its
  contents appear nowhere in that compare, per-commit file lists or not. The
  paragraph now says "can", names acceptance alongside wire bytes and epoch
  cadence, and tells the model to report the version move and then say the
  material does not carry what changed inside — the honest answer, where it
  used to hand down a conclusion.

  It first said something else, and the repository's own AI reviewer caught it:
  "read the `spqr` range itself (`gh api …/compare/<old>...<new>`)". The client
  that sends this prompt sends a plain completion with **no tools at all**, so
  that is an instruction the model cannot follow and can only appear to satisfy
  by inventing the answer — the very failure the paragraph was being rewritten
  to stop, reintroduced one level up, and contradicting the prompt rule added
  beside it. The command now lives in `CLAUDE.md`, addressed to whoever
  finishes the pull request, together with the reason the file list alone is
  not enough: on 1.5.3 → 1.6.0 `serialize.rs` appears in the diff and the
  serializer is byte-identical all the same.
- **The one warning that would have caught the stacked Highlights lines reached
  only the run log** (`scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`,
  `scripts/update_changelog.dart`,
  `.github/workflows/check-libsignal-updates.yml`,
  `test/scripts/update_changelog_test.dart`) — the v0.102.2 fix that stopped
  Highlights lines from stacking deliberately does **not** supersede a
  *rewritten* line, because those run onto continuation lines a line match
  would strand. It warns instead, and on v0.103.0 it warned exactly right:
  "the section now names two upstream versions — collapse them by hand before
  releasing". Nobody saw it. It is printed by the script, `CHANGELOG_OK` stays
  `true`, and the pull request renders a clean "AI-generated entry" line with
  no caveat anywhere.

  That is worse than cosmetic, because nothing downstream collapses them
  either: `make release` finalizes `[Unreleased]` by renaming the heading **in
  place**, so a section left naming two upstream versions is frozen into a
  released one, and released sections are immutable.

  The condition is now returned rather than only logged — `updateChangelog`
  hands back a `ChangelogUpdate` carrying it beside the model — and published
  through the `--ci-output` channel that already carried `ai_provider`. The
  pull request body gains a warning and a "Before Merge" action, the run gains
  an annotation, and the step summary gains a line. The key is written on
  **both** outcomes: one that appeared only when true could not be told apart
  from a script too old to emit it, and `false` is what lets a reader treat the
  silence as "checked". `ciOutputsFor` renders the block as a separate,
  testable function for the reason the `insertChangelogEntry` tests already
  demonstrated — the format is what breaks silently, and a test that exercises
  the predicate alone proves nothing about what reaches the file. One of its
  four cases is the trailing newline, since that file is appended to by several
  writers and an unterminated block takes the next one down with it.
- **The prompt never said how to read the one input it calls CRITICAL**
  (`scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`) — the scope section is pasted under
  "CRITICAL for classification" and rule 2 classifies every upstream change
  against it, but nothing told the model what kind of statement it was reading.
  A sentence there describing what a dependency's changes *do* is a statement
  about what such a change can REACH; handed over unqualified, in that
  position, it reads as a fact available to assert. That is the whole mechanism
  behind the v0.103.0 entry.

  Two paragraphs now travel with the block, in the idiom the file list beside
  it already uses — instructions attached to their data rather than filed in
  the rules list, so an edit to the rules cannot separate them. The first says
  the section states reachability and never a report about this release, and
  that a claim found there is the question to answer from the material, not the
  answer. The second states the limit that no enrichment of this pipeline can
  lift: **the compare covers ONE repository**, so a dependency living in
  another leaves a single trace in it — a version number in a manifest — and
  nothing about what changed inside. Where an entry would turn on that, it must
  say the material does not carry it rather than infer the change from the
  bump, from the dependency's name, or from what the scope section says such a
  change can reach.

## [7.3.0] - 2026-09-08

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **`IdentityKeyPair.sign()` signs with the identity key without copying it into
  the Dart heap** — the one route that existed read the `privateKey` getter and
  rebuilt a `PrivateKey` from those bytes, putting the long-term identity secret
  somewhere nothing can zeroize it. The getter still works, so nothing breaks;
  every call site in this package moved to the new method
- **libsignal v0.102.0** — unchanged this release
- **libsignal_frb v6.3.0** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **`PrivateKey.agree()` documents what it does not do** (`rust/src/api/keys.rs`)
  — it is the raw X25519 primitive, and its docstring said only that the output
  is sensitive and should be zeroed. That is true and insufficient: the three
  ways this method is misused are not memory-hygiene mistakes.

  The result is not a key. X25519 returns the x-coordinate of a curve point, a
  field element rather than a uniformly distributed 32-byte string, so
  encrypting with it directly is wrong even though the bytes look random — it
  belongs in a KDF first, and `hkdfDerive` on this same surface takes it as
  `inputKeyMaterial`. A single agreement between two long-lived keys returns the
  same secret forever, so on its own it provides no forward secrecy; that comes
  from ratcheting over ephemeral keys, which is what `SessionBuilder` and
  `SessionCipher` already do and what a caller of this method has to build.
  And the method authenticates nothing: libsignal rejects the all-zero shared
  secret a low-order public key produces, in constant time and as a thrown
  error rather than 32 zero bytes, but checking that the peer's public key is
  the expected one stays the caller's job.

  The docstring now says so, and says plainly that ordinary Signal Protocol use
  never needs this method. No behaviour changed — `rustContentHash` is
  unmoved, which is the mechanical confirmation that the FFI surface did not.

- **`IdentityKeyPair.sign()` signs without copying the identity secret into the
  Dart heap** (`rust/src/api/keys.rs`, `README.md`) — signing a signed pre-key or
  a Kyber pre-key with the long-term identity key had exactly one route:
  `PrivateKey.deserialize(bytes: identity.privateKey.toList())`, then `.sign()`
  on the result. That is what the README documented and what every call site in
  this repository did. It materialises the long-term identity private key as a
  `Vec<u8>` handed across FFI, and from there nothing can reach it: no `zeroize`
  in Rust, no `dispose()` on the Dart side, only the garbage collector at a time
  of its choosing. `identityKeyPair.sign(message: ...)` does the same work with
  the secret never leaving Rust.

  It grants no capability that was not already reachable: the `privateKey`
  getter it replaces can sign the same arbitrary bytes today, so this narrows the
  surface a secret is exposed on rather than widening what the key can do.
  Signatures from it are not interchangeable with `signAlternateIdentity`, which
  signs a domain-separated message — a fixed 32-byte prefix and a label ahead of
  the other identity key — and a serialized public key cannot begin with that
  prefix, so the two uses overlap only if a caller deliberately builds it.

  Upstream libsignal's `IdentityKeyPair` has no general-purpose `sign`; this is a
  deliberate addition on our side, and the `privateKey` getter still works, so
  nothing that relied on the old route breaks. The getter's own documentation now
  points at this method.

- **The README names the Flutter build-system skip that leaves `web/pkg/`
  unprovisioned** (`README.md`) — the build hook copies the WASM module into the
  consuming app's `web/pkg/`, and `flutter run -d chrome` reaches the hook only
  while Flutter still considers its `dart_build` target out of date. That
  target's cache key omits the target platform: a debug `flutter run` keys its
  build directory on the engine revision, the entrypoint, the build mode and the
  output path alone, so a debug run for another platform leaves a stamp naming
  its own dependencies, the next run for Chrome finds every one of them
  unchanged, logs `Skipping target: dart_build`, and the hook is never invoked.
  In an app whose `web/pkg/` is not already provisioned that surfaces as
  `RustLib.init()` failing on a 404 for `pkg/libsignal_frb.js`, with nothing in
  the output naming the hook or the platform that poisoned the stamp.

  Nothing in this package can close it — the skip happens above `hooks_runner`,
  so no dependency the hook declares is ever read — so *Known Limitations*
  documents the escapes instead: one `flutter build web`, which is keyed to its
  own build directory and always reaches the hook; deleting
  `build/*/dart_build.stamp`; or `flutter clean`. Once `web/pkg/` holds the right
  files, `flutter run -d chrome` serves them.

- **The Android libraries are built by a pinned cargo-ndk, and their 16 KB
  alignment is measured on the bytes that get uploaded**
  (`.github/workflows/build-libsignal.yml`, `scripts/verify_android_alignment.py`,
  `Makefile`) — Google Play has required an app's bundled native libraries to be
  16 KB-aligned, for apps targeting Android 15 or later, since 1 November 2025.
  Nothing here would have noticed a regression: a misaligned `.so` fails no test
  in this repository, it makes the **consuming** app unpublishable, which is the
  worst place to find out and somebody else's release that it stops.

  The alignment is supplied by cargo-ndk's linker flags —
  `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` and its `common-page-size` twin — and not by the
  NDK: r26-built and r28-built artefacts measure `p_align=0x4000` alike, and
  32-bit `armeabi-v7a` measures `0x1000` on both, correctly, the requirement
  being a 64-bit one. So the property belonged to a tool the release job
  installed with `cargo install cargo-ndk --locked` and no version, taking
  whatever was newest that day. It is pinned to `4.1.2` now, the version whose
  flags were read out of the binary, and the job verifies the result rather than
  trusting the pin: `make verify-android-alignment` reads ELF program headers
  directly — no `readelf`, no NDK — and fails closed on a non-ELF file, on a
  file with no `PT_LOAD` segments, and on finding nothing to check at all.

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **`main` requires the whole CI matrix, not just a codegen guard**
  (`.github/rulesets/protect-main.json`, `.github/rulesets/README.md`) — none of
  the four rulesets carried a `required_status_checks` rule, so a red CI run
  never blocked a merge. Eleven contexts are required now: `FRB bindings were
  regenerated` plus ten legs of the test matrix.

  Requiring the guard alone came first, and it closed the loop that guard was
  written for: it exists because replaying the AI reviewer over 47 merged pull
  requests put its recall on that one condition at 21%, and the two-line shell
  check that replaced it had reported ever since with nothing depending on it.
  Requiring the matrix as well was blocked on a mechanism rather than on a
  preference — see the `test.yml` entry under *Changed* for what had to move and
  why the two are inseparable.

  Two legs stay out of the ruleset while still running in the workflow.
  `test / Update Coverage Badge` is skipped on pull requests, so requiring it
  would assert nothing. `test / Test (Linux ARM64)` is out because of a flake —
  but the flake is not its property, and the runbook now says so on measured
  ground rather than on reputation. Across the 25 most recent `Tests` runs the
  signature `TimeoutException after 0:00:30` produced three isolated leg
  failures: `Windows x86_64` twice and `Linux ARM64` once, every other red run
  in that window being a genuine multi-job breakage. Three events over four legs
  cannot single out a platform, and "the slowest runner flakes" is not the
  answer either — the slowest leg by wall clock is `Linux x86_64` (248 s average
  against ARM64's 91 s) and it has never flaked. So the exclusion is chosen by
  what its absence costs — Linux stays required through
  `test / Test (Linux x86_64)`, while dropping Windows would leave that platform
  with no required coverage at all — and Windows stays required knowing it will
  occasionally fail on its own until the timeout is understood.

  Every context string was read off the head commit of a real pull request
  rather than off a push to `main`: the two triggers do not produce the same set
  of check runs — `Update Coverage Badge` reports `success` on one and `skipped`
  on the other — and it is the pull-request set that a merge gate is measured
  against. The runbook records that check, and records that applying an edited
  ruleset takes `make setup-repo-protections ARGS="--update"`, plain
  `setup-repo-protections` skipping one that already exists.

  Applied to `main` on 2026-09-07 and verified against the live API: the rule
  carries all eleven contexts, each with `integration_id` 15368 and
  `strict_required_status_checks_policy` still `false`; the Admin bypass and the
  other three rulesets are untouched; `rules/branches/main` reports the rule as
  effective, and a Dependabot branch still reports none. All four live rulesets
  match their committed JSON, and the `--update` PUT preserved
  `require_extra_approval_for_unattributed_changes`, a field GitHub stores as a
  default and the committed file does not carry — worth confirming rather than
  assuming, since a PUT sends the file and not the difference.

- **CI cross-compiles the three Android ABIs on every pull request**
  (`.github/workflows/test-reusable.yml`) — Android was cross-compiled in exactly
  one place, `build-libsignal.yml`, which runs on `workflow_dispatch` and on a
  `libsignal_frb-*` release tag. Every leg of the test matrix runs `make build`,
  which builds for the host. So an Android-only build failure was invisible on
  `main` under every green gate, and the workflow that would discover it is the
  one publishing binaries — at a moment when the tag has already been pushed and
  a crate version is already spent. All three ABIs rather than one, because a
  vendored-assembly failure can be architecture-specific while the same
  dependency carries assembly the other legs never reach. It builds and does not
  test: nothing in CI can execute an Android artefact without an emulator, and a
  compile-and-assemble failure is what this catches. The job reads
  `android_ndk_version` and the API level from the same answers
  `build-libsignal.yml` does, so the gate cannot run on a different toolchain
  than the release.

- **`make actionlint`, and a `Workflow Lint (actionlint)` job that runs it**
  (`.github/actionlint.yaml`, `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/test-reusable.yml`) —
  the workflows are the one part of this repository that nothing rehearses before
  merge: a job is only ever executed by pushing it, so a typo in an expression, a
  context that does not exist, or a `needs:` naming a renamed job all reach `main`
  and then fail on the very run that was supposed to gate them. actionlint reads
  them statically and hands every `run:` block to shellcheck, which is where most
  of what it finds lives — so the job asserts shellcheck is present rather than
  trusting the runner image, an absent one being a green gate that quietly
  stopped checking its most productive half. It is pinned by version and by
  checksum, because the step fetches an executable from a third-party release and
  runs it over the repository, and nothing bumps that pin automatically.
  Suppressions live in `.github/actionlint.yaml` rather than in flags, so a local
  run reports exactly what CI reports. Clean on this repository's workflows,
  divergent ones included, at the first run.

#### Changed

- **`test.yml` no longer filters pull requests by path, so every pull request
  runs the matrix** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) — this is what let the ruleset
  above grow past one context, and it is not a preference. A required check is
  satisfied by a check run reporting on the pull request's head commit, and the
  two ways a job can fail to run are not equivalent: a job excluded by a
  job-level `if:` still reports, as `skipped`, and counts as satisfied, while a
  workflow excluded by a workflow-level `paths:` reports nothing at all — and no
  setting reads a missing check as passed. While `test.yml` filtered
  `pull_request` by path, requiring any `test / …` context would have left every
  documentation-only pull request waiting forever with nothing to fix.

  The filter stays on `push`, where it guards the cache scope rather than a
  gate: a pull-request run can read the base branch's cache scope but never the
  reverse. The cost of dropping it was measured before it was paid — of the
  fifteen most recently merged pull requests, fifteen already matched it, so
  what changes in practice is that the rare documentation-only pull request now
  runs the matrix too.

  `test.yml`'s header states that asymmetry forward rather than only recording
  the decision, because the tempting repair if the cost ever bites is the filter
  coming back, and the correct one is a job-level `if:` on the expensive legs.

- **`make verify-frb-pins` tells a fuzz crate with nothing to say from one it
  cannot read** (`scripts/src/frb_pins.dart`, `scripts/verify_frb_pins.dart`,
  `test/scripts/frb_pins_test.dart`) — the sixth source `2761886` added was
  required outright. That is right here, where `rust/fuzz/Cargo.toml` pins
  `flutter_rust_bridge` and cargo refuses to resolve the fuzz crate against the
  main one when the two drift, and wrong everywhere else: the copier template
  generates a fuzz crate that takes the main crate by path and names
  flutter_rust_bridge nowhere, so the same file carried over unchanged turns the
  gate red on the first run of every generated project. Measured in a render
  rather than reasoned about: dropped into one, the old file fails the manifest
  for holding no readable pin, and the new one reports it as declaring no such
  dependency.

  A manifest that does not declare the crate is absent now, the way bindings are
  absent until `make codegen` has run. One that declares it but writes the
  version in a form the reader does not accept is still a failure: collapsing
  those two is how a gate ends up reporting agreement it never checked. The
  predicate that separates them is anchored to the start of a line, so a
  commented-out dependency does not count as one and `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`
  is not mistaken for it, and both directions are covered by tests that go red
  on the substring version somebody would otherwise simplify it to.

  Nothing about this repository's own check changes: all six sources still say
  2.13.0 and a fuzz crate left behind on an older pin still fails by name. The
  success line measures its own column instead of assuming eighteen characters,
  because two of the reasons a source can be absent are wider than that.

- **The pin's prose no longer counts files a particular checkout happens to
  have** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `Makefile`, `.github/dependabot.yml`) — six files
  can record the version and two of them are conditional, so "five files" and
  "the version has to move in four places at once" were each true of one
  project. The Dependabot comment now names `make verify-frb-pins` as the thing
  that enumerates them, which is the part that cannot go stale, instead of
  repeating a list beside it.

- **`make run-example-web` clears the stale `dart_build` stamp before it runs**
  (`Makefile`, `CLAUDE.md`) — the target wiped `example/web/pkg/` and trusted the
  build hook to refresh it, which the hook cannot do when Flutter never invokes
  it. `flutter run` shares one build directory, and so one `dart_build` stamp,
  between a debug run for macOS and a debug run for Chrome, because the target
  platform is not part of that directory's key; whichever ran first satisfies the
  other. The wipe then turned a stale `web/pkg/` into a missing one, so the
  example failed to start with a 404 for `pkg/libsignal_frb.js` rather than with
  the wrong WASM — the more confusing of the two failures, and the one that reads
  as a Rust or FRB bug. Deleting `example/build/*/dart_build.stamp` is correct by
  construction: a stamp that does not exist cannot be stale, and an unmatched glob
  under `rm -f` is a no-op, so a fresh tree is unaffected. Measured both ways
  before and after — with the stamp in place the hook does not run and
  `example/web/pkg/` stays missing; with it deleted the hook runs, and the dev
  server serves `pkg/libsignal_frb.js` and `pkg/libsignal_frb_bg.wasm` in full.
  The comment above the target no longer claims the hook "*should* refresh on its
  own", and `CLAUDE.md` carries the same warning.

- **The codegen guard regenerates the bindings instead of only reading a label**
  (`.github/workflows/codegen-guard.yml`) — the job's name promised more than it
  checked. It refused a pull request carrying `codegen-failed` and nothing else,
  which is right for the case it was written for and blind to the neighbouring
  one: a pull request that changes an existing signature is already caught,
  because `frb_generated.rs` stops compiling and `make build` goes red on four
  platforms — but one that *adds* a `pub fn`, or edits a docstring, compiles
  perfectly and simply lacks the function on the Dart side. That is the gap
  `bc0fdc9` fell through here, where a corrected Rust security note never reached
  the generated Dart. `make codegen` appeared in CI in exactly one place, the
  bot's own update workflow, and never as a gate on a human's pull request.

  The two rules are a disjunction — label present *or* regeneration moves
  something — which is worth stating because the file argues at length against
  the conjunction, and that argument still holds. Drift is read from
  `git status --porcelain`, not `git diff --exit-code`, because codegen can add a
  file and `git diff` is blind to an untracked path. The job name is untouched on
  purpose: `FRB bindings were regenerated` is a required status check in
  `protect-main.json`, matched as a string, so a rename or a second job would
  make the ruleset stop matching silently and leave every pull request waiting on
  a report nobody files. For the same reason the trigger still carries no
  `paths:` filter; the cost is avoided per step instead, with the regeneration
  half running only when the pull request touches something that can move the
  bindings.

- **Adopted copier template v4.8.0 → v4.9.0** (`.copier-answers.yml`) — much of
  the range is this repository's own work returning: the sixth pin source, the
  required status check and the `dart_build` stamp fix are the entries above,
  and they came back byte-identical, so `protect-main.json`, `frb_pins.dart`,
  `verify_frb_pins.dart` and `frb_pins_test.dart` were not touched at all. What
  actually arrived is the four items already listed plus two sweeps: every
  `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `$GITHUB_ENV`, `$GITHUB_PATH` and `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
  redirection is quoted, in the composite actions as well as the workflows — the
  reason the new lint gate is green at full strength rather than green because
  its noisiest check was off — and `.github/rulesets/README.md` gains the
  `actionlint` and three `Cross-compile (Android …)` contexts, which the runbook
  had been due to grow by hand.

  Two hand-merges. `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` conflicted and resolved to
  ours in full, both misalignments rather than disagreements: copier paired the
  template's new *Known Limitations* text against an unrelated heading, and its
  rewritten pin section against the security checklist. Both additions are
  already here, and this repository's wording of the fuzz-crate paragraph is the
  accurate one — our fuzz crate does name `flutter_rust_bridge`, where the
  template describes a generated one that does not. `.github/rulesets/README.md`
  merged with no conflict marker and a duplicated section: the template's
  rewritten runbook was appended beside the existing one, leaving two
  `### Required status checks` and two `### Why Dependabot branches are excluded`
  with contradictory context lists. The template's copy is kept — it is the one
  carrying the new contexts — with `test / Test (Linux ARM64)` pruned from it and
  named as pruned, which is what its own caution about flaky legs asks each
  project to do.

  `android_ndk_version` deliberately stays at r26. The template moved its
  *default* to r28 because OpenSSL 3.6 emits Intel SM3 assembly that r26's Clang
  17 cannot assemble, reached through `openssl-src` by projects that vendor
  SQLCipher; `rust/Cargo.lock` here contains no `openssl-src`, `openssl-sys`,
  `rusqlite` or `libsqlite3-sys`, so the reason does not apply and an update
  keeps a recorded answer regardless. The new Android job reads that same answer,
  so gate and release stay on one toolchain either way.

#### Fixed

- **The rulesets runbook described a bypass actor that is not there**
  (`.github/rulesets/README.md`) — it said **Signing commit** "is bypassed only
  by the update GitHub App" while its own table two paragraphs above said "none
  by default", the committed JSON has an empty `bypass_actors`, and so does the
  live ruleset. The conclusion the sentence draws — that not even an admin may
  force-push — is a consequence of the empty array, not of an actor, and the
  file says as much about `delete-branches.json` in the next section.

## [7.2.0] - 2026-09-06

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **flutter_rust_bridge 2.13.0** — bindings, the native crate's runtime and the
  published constraint all move together. **Action required** for anyone whose
  own `pubspec.yaml` constrains `flutter_rust_bridge` so as to exclude 2.13.0;
  an ordinary caret constraint needs no change
- **Rust 1.93.1 is the new floor for building the native library from source** —
  libsignal v0.102.0 raises its own; consumers who install the published binary
  through the build hook are unaffected
- **libsignal v0.102.0** — upstream bump. Nothing reaches the surface this
  package exposes: of the three files that changed in the crates we bind, two
  are comments and one is the version string
- **libsignal_frb v6.2.0** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **libsignal moves to v0.102.0, and nothing it changed is visible here**
  (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — the release is large upstream ([26 commits, 169
  files](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.101.2...v0.102.0))
  and its own notes lead with new typed chat APIs — account deletion, SVR
  credential checks, currency conversions, pre-key counts, device capabilities,
  sticker upload forms and TOTP/MFA key management — plus registration without
  an E.164 and a switch to gRPC by default. Every one of those lands in
  `libsignal-net-chat`, `libsignal-account-keys` or the Java, Node and Swift
  bridges, and not one of those crates is in this package's dependency graph at
  all.

  Four crates from that repository do reach the graph: `libsignal-protocol`,
  `libsignal-core` and `signal-crypto`, which this package names, and
  `libsignal-debug`, which arrives transitively. `signal-crypto` and
  `libsignal-debug` have no changed file in the range; `libsignal-protocol` and
  `libsignal-core` have three between them, and two of those are comments —
  `rust/protocol/src/sealed_sender.rs` (+2/-3, a doc comment swapping a dormant
  RFC link for a TODO about `slice::element_offset`), `rust/core/src/lib.rs`
  (+2/-3, an updated issue number in a comment about try-blocks) and
  `rust/core/src/version.rs` (the version string).

  Asked at the lockfile rather than the file tree, the answer is the same:
  `rust/Cargo.lock` holds 226 packages before and after, with **none added and
  none removed**, and four version moves — `libsignal-debug` 0.101.2 → 0.102.0,
  which inherits the workspace version, plus `cc` 1.4.4 → 1.4.5,
  `find-msvc-tools` 0.1.11 → 0.1.12 and `smallvec` 1.15.2 → 1.16.0.
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` records those four and nothing else. Upstream's two
  new workspace dependency bounds both miss this package: `displaydoc`'s floor
  rises to 0.2.6 where the graph already resolves 0.2.7, and the
  `tinyvec < 1.13.0` cap guards a crate the graph does not contain. Regenerating
  the bindings produced no change under `lib/src/rust/`; the FFI surface did not
  move

- **Building the native library from source now needs Rust 1.93.1**
  (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — libsignal v0.102.0 raises its workspace `rust-version`
  from 1.88 to 1.93.1, so the floor this package declares had to rise with it or
  the promise would be false: the manifest said 1.88 while the dependency could
  no longer be compiled by it. This is the from-source path only — consumers who
  install the precompiled binary through the build hook never invoke a Rust
  toolchain and are unaffected. **Action required** for anyone building from
  source on a toolchain older than 1.93.1: `rustup update`

- **`flutter_rust_bridge` moves to 2.13.0, and a consumer who pins it
  narrowly has to move with it** (`pubspec.yaml`) — the constraint is now
  `">=2.13.0 <2.13.1"`. It admits exactly one version for the reason 7.1.1
  documents: the runtime compares its own version against the
  `codegenVersion` recorded in `lib/src/rust/frb_generated.dart` with string
  equality, so every version a wider range admits except the one that generated
  the bindings fails `RustLib.init()`. Upstream says the same thing — *"all
  flutter_rust_bridge-related packages will need to have exactly the same
  version"*.

  The move is mechanical, and it was measured rather than assumed. The whole
  Dart diff under `lib/src/rust/` is 36 lines: the `@generated by` stamp in 17
  files and one `codegenVersion` string. `rustContentHash` does not move
  (450650216 before and after), so the wire signature between Dart and the
  native binary is unchanged. The generated Rust is hygiene only, and the
  377-line diff accounts for itself line by line: 173 lines spell `Ok(...)` as
  `std::result::Result::Ok(...)`, two spell it the other way round at the
  infallible wrappers (`Result::<_, ()>::Ok(x)` becomes `Ok::<_, ()>(x)`),
  eight drop one space after `move || {`, three carry the `@generated by`
  stamp, one carries `FLUTTER_RUST_BRIDGE_CODEGEN_VERSION`, and one adds
  `mismatched_lifetime_syntaxes` to the allow list. That is 188 lines removed
  and 189 added with nothing left unclassified. In `rust/Cargo.lock` the bump
  moves `flutter_rust_bridge_macros` in lockstep and pulls in no new transitive
  crate: the runtime's own 21 dependency edges are byte-identical.

  **Action required** only if you constrain `flutter_rust_bridge` yourself,
  and what happens when you don't act is worth stating exactly, because it is
  quieter than a failure. An ordinary `^2.12.0` is `>=2.12.0 <3.0.0`, admits
  2.13.0, and needs no change at all. A narrow pin that excludes 2.13.0 —
  `">=2.12.0 <2.12.1"`, the form this package itself ships — does **not** fail:
  pub backtracks and resolves the previous `libsignal` instead, and the only
  sign is the generic "packages have newer versions incompatible with
  dependency constraints" advisory, which names neither package. The upgrade is
  withheld rather than refused, so move your own constraint to
  `">=2.13.0 <2.13.1"` in the same commit that upgrades this package.
  Resolution fails outright only where no version satisfies both constraints —
  in practice the case 7.1.1 already described, a project that also depends on
  another flutter_rust_bridge wrapper built against a different version.

- **The dead `getrandom` 0.2 declaration is gone from the wasm32 block**
  (`rust/Cargo.toml`) — it had become its own only reason to exist. In
  `rust/Cargo.lock` the sole consumer of `getrandom 0.2.17` was `libsignal_frb`
  itself, which is to say this declaration; for contrast 0.3.4 had two
  consumers and 0.4.3 had four, of which one and three respectively were
  crates other than this one. So the declaration was not holding a backend on
  for some crate that needed it — it was the only thing holding that version in
  the graph at all, and removing it removed the version: 0.2.17 is no longer in
  the lockfile, and a wasm32 build now compiles exactly two getrandoms, 0.3.4
  and 0.4.3. `wasi 0.11.1+wasi-snapshot-preview1` went with it, having been
  reachable only through that version, so `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` — which
  ships inside the published archive — now lists 227 crates and 131 licence
  texts rather than 229 and 132.

#### Security

- **The HKDF doc no longer promises a zeroization that does not happen**
  (`rust/src/api/crypto.rs`) — its `# Security` block said the internal copy of
  the key material was "cleared when the `Hkdf` instance goes out of scope". It
  is not. `hkdf` 0.13 publishes no `[features]` at all, `hmac` 0.13 does have
  `zeroize = ["digest/zeroize"]`, and nothing in this crate's graph turns it on,
  so dropping an `Hkdf` runs no zeroizing `Drop` — it releases the memory for
  reuse. The arguments this function owns are still zeroized on every path,
  including the error one; what changed is that the note says which copy is
  cleared and which is not, and names the change that would close the gap
  (depend on `hmac` directly with its `zeroize` feature, gated on
  `make build-web` because it moves the dependency graph). Nothing about the
  derived output changes. Found by replaying the AI reviewer over merged pull
  requests. The correction reaches the **published** documentation with this
  release and not before: it was written into the Rust source without a
  `make codegen` run, so `lib/src/rust/api/crypto.dart` — which ships, being
  outside `.pubignore` — went on carrying the retracted claim. How that
  happened, and why no gate caught it, is under For Contributors.

#### Fixed

- **A dead reference in the published API documentation** (`lib/libsignal.dart`)
  — the library-level doc listed sender certificates as `[SenderCertificate]`, a
  type this package does not expose: they reach Dart as a function family
  (`createSenderCertificate`, `validateSenderCertificate`). dartdoc reports an
  unresolved reference as a warning and exits zero, so it shipped to pub.dev on
  every release that carried it and nothing ever said so. It was the only
  instance, and the gate below now makes that class a build failure.

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **Two documentation gates, and both block** (`dartdoc_options.yaml`,
  `make doc`, `make rust-doc`) — dartdoc's `unresolved-doc-reference` is
  promoted from a warning to an error, and rustdoc runs under `-D warnings` on
  the host and on wasm32. Both were red on adoption: one dead reference on the
  Dart side, three on the Rust side, all dead for as long as they had existed.
  They are the same mistake in both directions — flutter_rust_bridge copies a
  Rust doc comment into the generated Dart verbatim, and Rust's intra-doc syntax
  is not Dart's — so `rust/src/api/` now names the Dart surface in plain
  backticks, which links on neither side and rots on neither either.
  `dartdoc_options.yaml` is `.pubignore`d on purpose: pub.dev runs dartdoc
  itself and would honour the same promotion, which could break documentation
  generation for an already-published version.

- **wasm32 is executed, not merely compiled** (`make test-web`,
  `test-reusable.yml`) — CI gains `Build WASM` and `Rust unit tests (browser)`,
  and `make test-web` runs the crate's `cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")` tests in
  headless Chrome. Until now nothing covered those branches: `make test` is the
  Dart VM and `make build-web` only compiles, while a wasm32 body is a
  *different implementation* of the same function rather than the same code on
  another host. `rust/Cargo.toml` gains the harness that needs, as a wasm32
  `dev-dependencies` entry (`wasm-bindgen-test`); it is the only non-comment
  change to that manifest, so the shipped binary is untouched, and
  `make verify-third-party-notices` still passes with eleven new crates in
  `Cargo.lock` because `cargo tree --edges normal,build` excludes every
  dev-dependency on every target. First run here: 1 test, green.

- **A pull request whose FRB bindings were never regenerated is refused**
  (`.github/workflows/codegen-guard.yml`) — two lines of shell that fail any
  pull request carrying the `codegen-failed` label. It exists because the
  alternative was measured and lost: replaying the AI reviewer over all 47
  merged pull requests put its recall on this exact condition at 6 of 28, 21%,
  even though the label sits in plain text in the context file it reads and its
  reasoning on the ones it did catch was sound. A model that understands a rule
  and applies it one time in five is not a gate; the same rule stated directly
  is 100%. The condition is the label alone, deliberately — when codegen fails
  an unchanged `lib/src/rust/` is the *expected* state, so an extra "and the
  bindings did not change" clause would add nothing and would let the check pass
  on a pull request where somebody hand-edited generated output. `labeled` and
  `unlabeled` are in the trigger list so that removing the label after a manual
  fix re-runs the check rather than leaving the pull request red with nothing
  left to fix, and the labels are read back from the API rather than from the
  event payload, because the label is attached in the same breath as the pull
  request is opened. 28 pull requests merged carrying this label before the
  guard existed.

- **The SSv2 offsets guard is covered, by the only route that reaches it**
  (`test/sealed_sender/usmc_and_multi_recipient_test.dart`) — a message that
  parses always carries offsets inside its own buffer, so no amount of
  `sealedSenderV2ParseSentMessage` reaches the second guard in
  `receivedMessageFor`. It is reachable all the same, because
  `SealedSenderV2SentMessage` and `SealedSenderV2Recipient` are public value
  classes with public constructors: anything that persists a parse result and
  rebuilds it later hands that method numbers the parser never produced, and
  without the guard they go straight into `setRange`. Five tests — a control
  that fits, then a key range ending past the buffer, an inverted range, a
  shared offset past the end, and the empty-devices early return that answers
  before the offsets are read at all.

- **HKDF-SHA256 is pinned to RFC 5869, not just to itself**
  (`test/crypto/hkdf_kat_test.dart`) — `hkdf_test.dart` next door is round-trips
  and shape checks: it proves `hkdfDerive` is deterministic and that its output
  moves when its inputs do, and it would keep passing if every derived byte
  changed. The AES-GCM-SIV vectors added in 7.1.1 closed exactly that gap for
  the AEAD and left it open here. RFC 5869 publishes seven vectors; A.4-A.7 are
  HMAC-SHA1 and this package exposes no SHA-1 derivation, so the three SHA-256
  cases are the whole of what applies — including A.2, whose 82-octet output is
  the only one that runs the expansion past two rounds and so pins the block
  counter. A.3 earns its place twice over: its zero-length salt is the path
  `hkdfDerive` takes whenever a caller passes `[]`, which maps to HKDF's "salt
  not provided" and so to 32 zero bytes — which is the PRK the RFC computed it
  against.

- **The release profile's panic strategy has a test behind it**
  (`rust/src/utils.rs`, `release_profile_must_not_abort_on_panic`) — the
  manifest has said for several releases that the absence of a `panic` key in
  `[profile.release]` is load-bearing: `panic = "abort"` skips unwinding, so
  `Drop` never runs and every zeroize-on-Drop in this crate is silently
  bypassed, leaving key material in memory after any panic. Nothing checked it,
  and the surface is wide — ten files under `rust/src/api/` reach for
  `zeroize`, mostly through `Zeroizing`, whose wipe *is* a `Drop` impl and so
  exactly what unwinding runs. It reads the manifest rather than watching a
  panic because it has to: Cargo forces `panic = "unwind"` on the `test` and
  `bench` profiles and rejects the key on per-package overrides, so the setting
  that actually ships is unobservable from inside a test binary. Beyond the
  exact `[profile.release]` + `panic = "abort"` shape it rejects any
  non-comment line naming both `panic` and `abort` — TOML gives several ways
  around an exact header match, and enumerating them is the part that would
  rot. Verified against this manifest rather than in the abstract: green as it
  stands, red on the key planted inside `[profile.release]`, red on a
  non-comment line naming both elsewhere, and red again when the section is
  renamed away. The comment-stripping is proved by the pass rather than
  asserted — five comment lines in this manifest name both words. Adopted from
  the copier template, where it originated in a sibling project.

#### Changed

- **Adopted copier template v4.6.0 → v4.7.0** (`.copier-answers.yml`) — the two
  gates above are most of it. The rest: release builds are locked, so every
  `cargo build` and `cargo install` in `build-libsignal.yml` — the workflow that
  produces the shipped binaries — now passes `--locked` and builds from the
  committed lockfile rather than re-resolving; Dependabot stops proposing
  `hooks` and `code_assets` majors, which are blocked by the pinned Flutter SDK
  rather than by anything here and so cannot be merged or fixed in this
  repository; and bookkeeping stops outranking tests, with
  `verify-third-party-notices` and `verify-frb-pins` moving after the test steps
  so a stale inventory no longer fails the Linux leg before a single test has
  run. Eleven files came back conflicted. Four were merged rather than taken
  from either side: `rust/Cargo.toml` keeps `js-sys` — which the template render
  does not have and `rust/src/utils.rs` calls — and attaches the new
  unwinding note to the existing `[profile.release]` instead of the second one
  the template side would have added, which TOML rejects; `rust/deny.toml` keeps
  its live `RUSTSEC-2026-0173` entry under the template's new preamble, and
  keeps its own licence note, which states the AGPL-compatibility criterion the
  generic one replaces with an invitation to extend the list; `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  keeps the headings its own table of contents links to and takes the template's
  prose; `SECURITY.md` keeps this project's reporting section and takes the note
  that private vulnerability reporting has to be enabled per repository before
  the link works for outside reporters. The new `enable_freezed` answer is
  false: flutter_rust_bridge needs `freezed` only for data-carrying enums and
  structs this API does not have, and answering it once replaces stripping the
  three dependencies by hand after every update. `README.md` was taken whole
  from this side — all four of its conflicts were misalignments against a
  locally rewritten file, and one template side was a code fence that never
  closed

- **The Dependabot ignore that was holding setup-dart back is deleted, because
  it never held anything back** — Dependabot parses a `github-actions` ignore
  through `Gem::Requirement`, which has no wildcard expansion. `"1.8.x"` becomes
  `= 1.8.x`, a version string nothing equals: 1.7.2, 1.8.0, 1.8.1 and 1.9.0 all
  fail it. The bot went on rebuilding its branch over the very commit that added
  the entry, with 1.8.1 still in the diff. An ignore that reads as protection
  and enforces nothing is worse than no entry at all, and the real fix now sits
  in the action itself.

- **`rand` is ignored at `>= 0.10.0` until libsignal moves** — an `OsRng` is
  handed by `&mut` straight into libsignal's own `Rng + CryptoRng` bounds at 19
  call sites in `rust/src/api/`, and those bounds are rand 0.9's traits;
  `libsignal-protocol`, `libsignal-core` and `spqr` all resolve rand 0.9.5. A
  0.10 `UnwrapErr<OsRng>` implements a *different* `RngCore`, so the bump cannot
  compile. It is written as a `versions` range rather than `update-types`
  because Dependabot's trailers call 0.9 → 0.10 `semver-minor`, so an ignore
  aimed at majors would never fire — the same trap the group filter above it
  already documents.

- **`getrandom` is ignored at `>= 0.4.0`, because the manifest declares it
  twice** — two majors are live in the wasm32 graph at once and each needs its
  browser backend enabled by name, so `rust/Cargo.toml` carries `getrandom` 0.3
  (reached through `libsignal-core` and `rand_core` 0.9) alongside
  `getrandom_04`, a renamed declaration of the same crate at 0.4 (reached
  through `aes-gcm-siv` → `aead` → `crypto-common`). Dependabot sees one
  dependency and raised the **0.3** one to 0.4, pointing both names at a single
  version; cargo refuses that outright — *"depends on crate `getrandom v0.4.3`
  multiple times with different names"* — which is why three jobs went red. The
  name clash was not even the whole defect: `libsignal-core` keeps 0.3.4 in the
  lockfile regardless, so it would have been left with no `wasm_js` backend,
  because the retargeted declaration was the only thing enabling it — a
  `compile_error!` inside `getrandom` on the next `make build-web`. A `versions`
  range rather than a blanket ignore, so 0.3.x patches still arrive. Not
  measured, and assumed against us: whether an ignore keyed on the dependency
  name also withholds 0.4.x patches from `getrandom_04`.

- **`anthropics/claude-code-action` moves to v1.0.213** (`ai-review.yml`,
  `repair-build.yml`) — the pin sat at 1.0.210 because Dependabot's metadata
  cache was behind the real releases when it last ran, not because 1.0.210 was
  chosen on merit. Both SHAs were dereferenced against the upstream annotated
  tags before merging, since comparing a `refs/tags/*` object id against a
  pinned commit id compares two different things and would have reported a
  mismatch that is not one.

- **`lints` moves to `>=6.1.0 <6.2.0`** — the window slides onto the minor the
  matrix has already run green and stays one minor wide, so a new lint release
  still arrives as a pull request the four platforms evaluate rather than as a
  silent change of what `make analyze` enforces.

- **`make coverage` measures the code somebody wrote** — everything under
  `lib/src/rust/` is now excluded, not just the `frb_generated*` files: the rest
  of that directory is the same generator's output one layer up, and 41 of the
  45 lines it left uncovered were `hashCode` and `operator ==` on value
  classes. Including them meant a `make codegen` run could move the badge with
  nobody having written a line, which is what took the figure from 100% to
  93.8% when the sealed-sender surface grew. The denominator drops from 720
  lines to the 468 hand-written ones, and with the guard test above it reads
  100.0% again. The Makefile
  comment records why the second glob is not written `**/lib/src/rust/**`: a
  glob starting with `**` can never match an absolute path, so that form is
  tested only against the relative path, matches nothing, and turns the ignore
  off without saying so.

- **The repair agent is told what it is explaining, and to leave generated
  files alone** — its second pass on PR #67 lost the diagnosis: a new
  flutter_rust_bridge landed between the two runs, the repair job's own
  checkout began failing for an unrelated reason, and that local reproduction
  displaced the recorded log as the thing being explained. The agent was not
  what broke; the invariant was simply never written down. The prompt now
  states it — the subject is the failure in the log of the run named in
  `failure.env`, anything met locally that does not match it is a second
  finding for `notes` rather than `cause`, and a failure that does not
  reproduce is a `cannot-fix` naming the recorded failure rather than a licence
  to adopt some other one.
  It also forbids editing generated output by hand: the fix that pass produced
  was a single `codegenVersion` line under `lib/src/rust/`, which the next
  `make codegen` reverts, so the red was silenced rather than repaired. Those
  paths may still change — by changing what generates them and running
  `make codegen`, which the agent is already permitted to run.

- **The `getrandom` removal waited for a release branch** — nothing local
  proved a wasm32 dependency change at the time, because `make build` is
  host-only and CI then compiled wasm **only** on a `libsignal_frb-*` tag push.
  A graph change merged without running `make build-web` first is one whose Web
  target is compiled for the first time inside a release — which is how two
  crate versions were already burned. This one was gated on `make build-web`
  before it was committed. The constraint itself is gone as of this release:
  `Build WASM` and `Rust unit tests (browser)` run on every push and pull
  request now, so the tag is no longer the first time wasm is compiled.

- **`analysis_options.yaml` joins the test workflow's path filters**
  (`.github/workflows/test.yml`, on `push` and `pull_request` both) — that file
  decides what `make analyze` reports, so a commit changing only the lint
  configuration was precisely the one that did not re-run the gate it changes.
  The same reasoning already carries `dartdoc_options.yaml`, one entry above
  it. Adopted from the copier template.

- **Adopted copier template v4.7.0 → v4.8.0** (`.copier-answers.yml`) — a near
  no-op, and deliberately so: almost everything in v4.8.0 started here. The
  panic guard and the `analysis_options.yaml` filter were taken by hand from the
  template's unreleased work before this release, and the two anchored version
  readers and the stage-2 staleness check were written here and backported, so
  the update mostly delivered this repository's own commits back to it. `0`
  rejected hunks; `scripts/src/common.dart`, `scripts/src/release.dart` and both
  their test files were not touched at all, because the template renders them
  byte-identically to what is committed here — which was the point of matching
  the render rather than merely fixing the same bug twice.

  Two files conflicted, both standing keep-ours divergences resolved to ours:
  `CLAUDE.md`, whose two-stage release section is richer than the template's,
  and `README.md`, where copier paired our `### Key Types` heading against the
  platform table — a misalignment rather than a disagreement, since our table
  already carries the iOS `x64 (sim)` correction that went upstream.

  Neither of the two things that actually needed attention was a conflict.
  Copier inserted its own "push first" paragraph into `CLAUDE.md` **outside** the
  conflict brackets, where a blind keep-ours would have kept it alongside ours
  and said the same thing twice; and `test/scripts/frb_pins_test.dart` merged
  clean and wrong, with the anchoring regression test present **twice** —
  copier reconstructs the pre-update render, which predates the hand-added test,
  so the resulting patch applies it again. Duplicate test names are legal Dart,
  so nothing failed; the suite simply ran it twice. Both were removed. Net
  effect once resolved: the `_commit` bump, plus copier rewriting
  `rust_version: '1.93.1'` without quotes, which YAML reads identically.

#### Fixed

- **The fuzz crate stopped building the moment the main crate moved to
  flutter_rust_bridge 2.13.0, and no gate could see it**
  (`rust/fuzz/Cargo.toml`, `scripts/src/frb_pins.dart`) — `rust/fuzz` pins
  `flutter_rust_bridge` directly *and* takes the main crate by path, so the
  `=2.12.0` it kept when `4f47a2e` raised the main crate to 2.13.0 was not
  drift: cargo cannot resolve the two together at all. `cargo metadata` there
  exits 101 with "failed to select a version for `flutter_rust_bridge`", which
  makes every fuzz target unbuildable, locally and in CI. Three separate things
  had to miss it, and each did. `rust/fuzz` is its own workspace root, so no
  resolution under `rust/` ever passes through it. The `Fuzz` workflow triggers
  on `rust/**` pull requests and a weekly cron but **not** on a push, and
  `4f47a2e` reached `main` as a push — so the first red run was somebody else's
  pull request, days later. And `make verify-frb-pins`, the gate whose whole job
  is that these versions move together, read five files and not this one, even
  though the pin carries a comment saying it must match the main crate. The pin
  is now 2.13.0, and the gate reads six files: a bump that forgets the fuzz
  crate now fails on the constraint instead of in a fuzz run nobody is watching.
  `FrbPin` also records absence rather than inferring it from the wording of its
  own message, which a second optional source would otherwise have made
  load-bearing.

- **The corrected HKDF note reached Rust but never reached Dart**
  (`lib/src/rust/api/crypto.dart`) — the `# Security` correction recorded above
  was written into `rust/src/api/crypto.rs` without a `make codegen` run, so the
  generated Dart still carried the claim the correction exists to retract: that
  the internal copy of the key material is cleared when the `Hkdf` value is
  dropped. flutter_rust_bridge copies a Rust doc comment into the Dart output
  verbatim, which makes a docstring edit a bindings edit, and nothing in CI
  compares committed bindings against what codegen produces on a hand-made
  commit — the `bindings=changed` tripwire lives in
  `check-libsignal-updates.yml`, on the automated upstream path only, and
  `codegen-guard.yml` refuses a labelled pull request rather than comparing
  anything. Regenerating moved nothing else: `rustContentHash` is unchanged at
  450650216, so the wire signature did not shift.

- **A rate-limited GitHub reply no longer becomes "no release notes were
  published"** (`scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`) — `curl -s` carries no
  `-f`, so it exits 0 on 403, 429 and every 5xx, and the only other guard
  matched the single exact string `Not Found`. A rate-limited reply reads "API
  rate limit exceeded for <ip>", missed both tests, fell through to an absent
  `body`, and returned the "nothing was published" sentence — an API failure
  laundered into a fact the changelog was then written from, in a script whose
  stated rule is that nothing is guessed and the entry is left unwritten. The
  request is unauthenticated, so the ceiling is 60 an hour per IP and the
  runners share IPs. The decision now lives in `releaseNotesFrom`, split out so
  it can be tested without a network, and keys on `tag_name` rather than `body`
  because a real release with an empty body is the ordinary case here and had to
  keep working; `_fetchUpstreamCommits` next door already tested for `commits`
  for the same reason and was never affected. Six tests cover it, and all three
  failure cases fail without the guard. Found by replaying the AI reviewer over
  merged pull requests.

- **Four dropped tokens in the AES-GCM-SIV vector file, one of them
  load-bearing** — `test/crypto/aes_gcm_siv_kat_test.dart` shipped in 7.1.1
  with `${i + 1}` missing from both loop-generated test names, so its 48 tests
  carried two names between them: a failing vector named no vector, and
  `dart test -n` could select none. The header lost `aes-gcm-siv` from two
  sentences in the same edit — "a future bump of  — or a change" and
  "transcribed from the  crate's own" — leaving the file warning about a bump
  of nothing and citing no source for its table. The vectors themselves, and
  everything they assert, were never affected.

- **`dart-lang/setup-dart` moves to 1.8.1, and the reason it was held at 1.7.2
  is switched off in the same commit** — 1.8.0 added a problem matcher for
  `dart analyze` and registers it with `::add-matcher::dart-analyzer.json`,
  resolving that path against `GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`. For an action invoked from
  inside another composite action that variable holds the *caller's* directory,
  so the runner looked for `.github/actions/setup-fvm/dart-analyzer.json`, did
  not find it, and failed the job seconds in — before anything was built. It
  took down all four test legs, and `publish.yml` and `build-libsignal.yml`
  call the same action, so a release would have hit it too. Upstream
  ([dart-lang/setup-dart#198](https://github.com/dart-lang/setup-dart/issues/198))
  is open and 1.8.1 does not fix it, so the SHA pin advances together with
  `problem-matcher: 'false'` rather than ahead of it: that input only exists
  from 1.8.0 on, so neither half is safe on its own. Nothing in this action
  runs `dart analyze` — that job uses the FVM-pinned SDK — so the matcher buys
  nothing here even when it works.

- **Two version parsers could be answered by a comment**
  (`scripts/src/common.dart`, `scripts/src/frb_pins.dart`) — both read a file
  as text with an unanchored pattern and `firstMatch`, which takes whichever
  match comes first rather than the declaration. `getUpstreamVersion` is the
  one that mattered: a commented-out `libsignal-protocol = { … tag = "…" }` —
  the shape an upgrade leaves behind — outranked the real pin below it, and in
  the dangerous direction a comment naming a *newer* tag makes
  `make check-new-libsignal-version` report the dependency as already current,
  so an upstream release, security fixes included, silently never lands.
  Nothing fails; the update just never happens. Measured rather than supposed:
  against the old pattern a stale comment above the real pin read `v0.101.2`,
  and a comment naming `v0.999.0` read `v0.999.0`. Both patterns are now
  anchored to the start of a line, the inline table may no longer span lines,
  and the parsing rule is split out of the disk read as `parseUpstreamTag` so
  it is testable without a fixture tree — the way `frb_pins.dart` already
  splits every reader from the disk. Seven tests cover the two, and four of
  them fail against the previous patterns. The same fix went to the copier
  template, which renders this file byte-identically, so no divergence is
  introduced.

- **Stage 2 would have accepted a stale native binary** (`scripts/src/release.dart`)
  — the preflight checked only that a GitHub Release named
  `libsignal_frb-<crate version>` *existed*. The crate version does not move
  until stage 1 runs, so `make release` on its own found the release left by the
  previous cut, passed, and would have published these bindings against that
  binary. Not hypothetical here: `libsignal_frb-6.1.3` exists and was built from
  libsignal v0.101.2 with flutter_rust_bridge 2.12.0 codegen, while this tree
  generates 2.13.0 against v0.102.0. Neither runtime net would have caught it —
  `rustContentHash` compares the FFI *surface*, which is byte-identical across
  exactly this mismatch (450650216 both sides), and the codegen assert compares
  the bindings against the flutter_rust_bridge *runtime package*, never against
  the native library. What differs is the generator that decided the argument
  marshalling, so the failure would be a wire mismatch inside a consumer's app —
  the same shape as the `Option::unwrap()` arg-count panic behind 6.0.1. The
  preflight now also reads `frb_generated.dart` and `rust/Cargo.toml` **at the
  tag** and refuses when either the codegen version or the upstream pin differs
  from the working tree, naming both. It reads them over the GitHub API rather
  than fetching the tag, because over-fetching tags is what aborted a release
  once already; it fails closed when it cannot read them; and `--skip-frb-check`
  remains the escape hatch. The comparison is a pure function
  (`describeFrbReleaseDrift`) so it is covered without a fixture tree, and it was
  run against the real 6.1.3 tag: two refusals, both correct, and silent when the
  tag matches the tree.

- **`make verify-frb-pins` documented five sources and reads six**
  (`scripts/src/frb_pins.dart`, `Makefile`) — the file header and the target
  comment were left behind when `rust/fuzz/Cargo.toml` joined the gate;
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` had already been updated. The count is the whole of what
  those comments claim, so a wrong one is the same prose-versus-code drift the
  gate itself exists to catch.

## [7.1.1] - 2026-09-01

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **libsignal v0.101.2** — upstream bump. One change does land in a surface this
  package exposes, and it is an internal API migration with no behavioural
  effect; sealed sender's cipher state is now cleared on drop
- **libsignal_frb v6.1.3** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **libsignal updated to v0.101.2**, across two upstream releases
  ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.101.0...v0.101.2))
  — 139 files over 26 commits. Neither v0.101.1 nor v0.101.2 published any
  release notes, so the diff is the whole account of what arrived. Exactly three
  files land in the crates this package binds, and both substantive ones are
  from v0.101.1; for these crates v0.101.2 is the version constant alone.
  `rust/core/src/version.rs` is that constant.
  `rust/protocol/Cargo.toml` turns on the `zeroize` feature (below).
  `rust/protocol/src/sealed_sender.rs` is an `aead` 0.5 → 0.6 migration —
  `encrypt_in_place_detached` becomes `encrypt_inout_detached`, `AeadInPlace`
  becomes `AeadInOut` — passing the same key, nonce and associated data, so the
  wire format does not move. That is checked rather than assumed: the six
  differential tests in `rust/src/ssv2_equivalence_tests.rs`, which reassemble a
  real multi-recipient message and compare it byte-for-byte against upstream's
  own output, all pass against v0.101.2. Everything else upstream is in the
  bridge and the Swift/Java/Node bindings, message-backup, net, attest, zkgroup
  and media, none of which this package exposes. `make codegen` produced no diff
  in `lib/src/rust/`, so the FFI surface is unchanged.

- **This crate's RustCrypto dependencies now match the ones libsignal resolves**
  — `sha2` 0.10 → 0.11, `hkdf` 0.12 → 0.13 and `aes-gcm-siv` 0.11 → 0.12. The
  first two had been a version behind `libsignal-protocol` for some time and the
  third fell behind with the bump above, so the graph was resolving two copies
  of each: two `sha2`, two `hkdf`, two `aes-gcm-siv` and two `aead`. It now
  resolves one of each, and the binary carries one implementation of each
  primitive rather than two.

  The three could not be bumped separately, which is how they were offered —
  three separate pull requests, each of which fails to build. `sha2` 0.11 moves
  to `digest` 0.11 while `hkdf` 0.12 still expects `digest` 0.10, so
  `Hkdf::<Sha256>::new` stops type-checking under either bump alone; applying
  both at once resolves it, and that part needed no code change.

  `aes-gcm-siv` 0.12 brings `aead` 0.6, where `Array::from_slice` is deprecated
  in favour of `TryFrom`. The two nonce conversions in `rust/src/api/crypto.rs`
  were rewritten accordingly. The length is validated a few lines above either
  of them, so the conversion cannot fail; it is handled rather than unwrapped so
  that a later change to that check cannot become a panic crossing the FFI
  boundary.

  **Ciphertext is unchanged**, which matters because anything encrypted by an
  earlier release has to stay readable. That is now pinned by a test rather than
  argued — see the RFC 8452 vectors below.

  One thing had to be named for the Web build to keep working. `aes-gcm-siv`
  0.12 enables `aead/getrandom` by default, `aead` 0.6 forwards that to
  `crypto-common`, and `crypto-common` depends on `getrandom` 0.4 with **no**
  target cfg — so that crate is now compiled for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, where
  it refuses to build unless its browser backend is selected by name. Two
  getrandom majors were already declared in `rust/Cargo.toml` for exactly this
  reason; 0.4 is now declared alongside them with `wasm_js`. No other platform
  was affected — the twelve native targets built before this was added.

#### Security

- **Sealed sender's AES-GCM-SIV key material is cleared on drop** — upstream
  enabled the `zeroize` feature of `aes-gcm-siv` for `libsignal-protocol`. This
  package exposes sealed sender, so the hardening reaches consumers through the
  native binary rather than staying upstream.

#### Fixed

- **`RustLib.init()` threw for anyone who resolved this package after
  2026-08-23** (`pubspec.yaml`) — `flutter_rust_bridge` was declared as
  `^2.12.0`, while the committed `lib/src/rust/frb_generated.dart` records
  `codegenVersion => '2.12.0'` and the runtime compares that string to its own
  with `==`. flutter_rust_bridge 2.13.0 was published on 2026-08-23 and landed
  inside the caret, so every fresh resolution from that day on — this
  repository's CI and every consumer of the published package alike — failed
  initialisation with `codegen version (2.12.0) should be the same as runtime
  version (2.13.0)`. `pubspec.lock` is deliberately not committed for a
  library, so nothing held the version still, and the shipped archive carries
  both halves of the contradiction: the caret in its pubspec and the generated
  file that fixes the other side. The two pins that were already exact,
  `="2.12.0"` in `rust/Cargo.toml` and `FRB_CODEGEN_VERSION` in the `Makefile`,
  were never the ones at risk.

  The constraint now admits exactly one version, written `>=2.12.0 <2.12.1`.
  Nothing wider is safe: the check is string equality, so every version a range
  admits except the one that generated the bindings fails, and `>=2.12.0
  <2.13.0` would only narrow the window — flutter_rust_bridge ships patch
  releases, and a 2.12.1 would break it identically. One version is also what
  upstream documents — *"all flutter_rust_bridge-related packages will need to
  have exactly the same version"* — and what its own `integrate` step writes
  with `dart pub add`.

  The range form, rather than the bare `2.12.0`, is forced by the release path
  and not by taste. `dart pub publish` warns that a single-version constraint
  "should allow more than one version", and it exits 65 on any warning, so
  `make publish-dry-run` — which both `make release` and `publish.yml` gate on
  — fails, and the package cannot be published at all. `>=2.12.0 <2.12.1`
  resolves to the same single version and does not trip that check. Measured
  rather than assumed: four constraint shapes were run through
  `dart pub publish --dry-run`, and only the bare version produced the warning.

  One consequence for consumers, and it is the intended one. Anyone who also
  depends on another flutter_rust_bridge wrapper built against a different
  version now gets a version-solving failure out of `pub get`, instead of a
  successful resolve followed by a throw at `init()`. The incompatibility was
  always there — two sets of generated bindings cannot both equal one runtime
  version — so what changes is only that it surfaces where it can be acted on.

  Nothing else moves. `rustContentHash` is unchanged, so the published native
  binary still matches and no rebuild or regeneration is needed. Verified by
  resolving a clean checkout both ways: 2.13.0 with 54 failures before, 2.12.0
  with all 714 tests passing after.

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **AES-256-GCM-SIV is pinned to RFC 8452, not just to itself**
  (`test/crypto/aes_gcm_siv_kat_test.dart`) — the existing cipher tests are
  round-trips. They prove encrypt and decrypt agree with each other, and they
  would keep passing if the ciphertext bytes moved, which is exactly what
  swapping an implementation can do — and this release swaps one. The 24
  published vectors from Appendix C.2 now run through the public Dart API in
  both directions, so a future bump of `aes-gcm-siv`, or a change to how the
  nonce is converted, cannot silently make data written by an earlier release
  unreadable.

- **An agent proposes a fix when `main` goes red** — `repair-build.yml` runs
  daily; when the latest completed `Tests` run on `main` failed, it hands that
  run's log to an agent and opens a pull request with the proposed fix. This
  task was picked to be first precisely because its oracle is real: the pull
  request is checked by the same four-platform matrix as any other, so a wrong
  fix costs a review rather than a merge.
  **The agent holds no credential that can write to this repository.** The work
  is split across three jobs — detect, repair, propose — and the GitHub App
  token is minted in the third, which the agent does not run in. The repair job
  checks out with `persist-credentials: false`, so no token is left in
  `.git/config` for its `Bash` tool to find, and its work leaves that job as a
  patch file rather than as a branch.
  What it may change is enforced by a path allowlist after the fact, not
  entrusted to the prompt. `.github/**` is outside it deliberately: the cheapest
  way to turn a build green is to weaken whatever reported it, and that has to
  be a human's decision. `.githooks/**` is outside it too — those files carry an
  executable bit that the signed-commit API cannot represent, so the push would
  be rejected anyway.
  The commands it may run are enumerated rather than wildcarded, which is not
  the same caution repeated. `Bash(make:*)` would have admitted `make release`,
  `make publish`, `make update-changelog` and `make setup-repo-protections`; the
  push at the end of `make release` fails for want of a credential, but only
  after it has bumped `pubspec.yaml` in the working tree — and `pubspec.yaml` is
  *inside* the path allowlist, so a version bump would have ridden along in the
  pull request looking like part of the fix. `cargo` is enumerated for the same
  reason: `cargo publish` shares a prefix with `cargo check`. `ls` and `rg` were
  dropped in favour of `Glob` and `Grep`, which do the same work but are scoped
  to the workspace — `rg` reads any path the process can, `/proc/self/environ`
  included, which is where this job's secrets live.
  **Nothing carrying a secret is published.** This repository is public, so its
  Actions logs and pull-request bodies are too, and the verdict is free text an
  agent wrote after reading a log that third parties contribute to — copied into
  a body created through the API, which never passes the log masking that would
  otherwise catch a key. Before anything leaves the agent's job, the patch and
  the verdict are scanned for the values of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and the job
  token, and a hit fails the run rather than redacting: a secret reaching that
  point means something went wrong earlier, and publishing a censored copy would
  hide it. The scan names only the variable, never the value. Verdict fields are
  capped at 4000 characters each, because a rehearsal produced 3500 and an
  unbounded public write should not be one field away.
  Three states that would otherwise pass for success are made loud. The agent
  must leave a `verdict.json`; its absence means the run exhausted its turns or
  crashed, which is otherwise indistinguishable from "nothing needed fixing".
  A verdict of `fixed` with an empty diff fails instead of opening an empty pull
  request. And the failing run must be judging `main`'s current tip — cutting a
  branch from an older commit would open a pull request that reverts whatever
  landed in between.
  **What the agent is given is prepared for it, and that is where the cost is.**
  A rehearsal against a real failure measured 2.19M cached input tokens over 24
  turns against a ~100K context, of which the 218 KB log was more than half —
  the log, not the model tier, is what a run costs, and it is paid for on every
  turn rather than once. The error lines and their surroundings came to 13 KB
  for the same failure, so a distilled `build-failure.summary` is now the entry
  point and the full log stays beside it for when the summary leaves a question
  open. Alongside it, `run-context.md` carries how every other job in the failing
  run concluded and how `main` has fared lately: both rehearsals reached for
  exactly that and it was decisive — a leg green on the same commit, and a
  symptom striking a different test each time — and neither fact is anywhere in
  the failing job's log. Gathering it in a script rather than granting the agent
  `gh` avoids putting a token in its environment and avoids trusting a prefix
  match to keep `gh` read-only.
  The log is third-party text — compiler, package-manager and dependency output
  — so the prompt frames it explicitly as data rather than instructions. Those
  instructions live in `.github/agent-prompts/repair-build.md` rather than in
  the workflow or in `.claude/skills/`: a prompt in a plain file is reviewable
  on its own, diffable, and portable to another engine.
  **Configuration:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the same secret the CHANGELOG entry
  uses, checked for presence before the agent is called so a missing one names
  itself instead of surfacing as an authentication error from inside a
  third-party action; and `AGENT_CLAUDECODE_MODEL`, which names the model and
  has no default. `workflow_dispatch` takes
  a `run_id` and a `dry_run` flag so the whole path can be rehearsed against a
  past failure instead of waiting for `main` to break — and a rehearsal against
  a commit that is no longer the tip is forced into a dry run, so it cannot open
  a reverting pull request.
  **Every run says what it decided, and the commonest decision is not a pull
  request.** A step summary in each of the first two jobs records whether an
  agent is configured at all, what the latest `Tests` run on `main` concluded,
  which engine and model ran, and the verdict with its reasoning — so "the
  automation is switched off" and "the automation looked and `main` is fine" stop
  producing identical-looking green runs. When the agent returns `cannot-fix` a
  fourth job files an issue carrying the diagnosis, keyed to the broken commit so
  one failure gets one issue. That outcome is the one this workflow reaches most
  often — `main` went red four times in five weeks here and every one was a flaky
  runner — and it used to leave nothing behind but an annotation, which is to say
  the agent's usual and correct answer was the one nobody was told about. An
  issue rather than a red run, because a daily failure for a condition that
  resolves itself is how people learn to ignore a workflow, and declining to act
  is the behaviour the prompt asks for rather than an error. The job that files
  it holds the App token and runs no agent, the same split the pull-request path
  uses, and the secret scan now covers both publication paths rather than only
  the pull request. A fifth job retires those issues once `main` is green again,
  so a report cannot outlive its subject and turn a useful signal into a list
  nobody reads — but it leaves alone anything somebody has commented on or
  assigned to themselves, because at that point closing it would be a bot
  overruling a person on a judgement it is not making. It reads the issue list
  on the read-only token and mints the App token only when there is something to
  close, so an ordinary green day creates no write credential at all.

- **A second engine for the repair agent: OpenCode, on any provider**
  — `vars.AGENT_ENGINE` selects `claude-code` or `opencode`, and neither is a
  default: an unset engine attempts no repair and says so, because something
  that writes into this repository should be named by a person rather than
  inherited from whatever a template shipped. The claim that the prompt was
  "portable to another engine" is now
  load-bearing rather than aspirational: both engines read the same
  `.github/agent-prompts/repair-build.md`, work on the same prepared evidence,
  and are judged by the same path allowlist, secret scan and `verdict.json`
  contract afterwards. Only the agent call itself differs, which is what keeping
  it to a single step was for.
  **The motivation is per-repository cost.** The bill is dominated by cached
  input replayed on every turn, so it scales with the number of repositories
  rather than with how often `main` breaks; across three that is the difference
  between dollars and cents per month. Engines are compared on the whole
  workload rather than on sticker rates, because a cheap model without prompt
  caching can cost more than an expensive one with it.
  **Neither engine's own GitHub Action is used.** OpenCode ships one, but it is
  driven by `/opencode` comments on issues and pull requests and opens the pull
  request itself. Both are things this workflow deliberately does not do —
  comment triggers carry someone else's text straight into an agent's context,
  and opening the pull request from the agent's job would put a write credential
  in exactly the job that is kept free of one. Installing the CLI keeps the
  three-job split intact.
  **The permission model is translated rather than approximated**, and lands
  tighter than the Claude Code side. It lives in
  `.github/agent-config/opencode.json`, outside the path allowlist, so the agent
  cannot widen its own permissions and have that ride along in the pull request.
  Commands are enumerated as exact strings with no wildcards at all: OpenCode
  matches glob patterns, so a trailing `*` would make `make test *` also match
  `make test && make release` — and `make release` bumps `pubspec.yaml`, which
  is *inside* the path allowlist. Exact patterns cannot absorb a `&&` clause, so
  that closes structurally rather than by trying to blacklist shell operators.
  `cargo` is absent entirely, since CLAUDE.md tells the agent never to call it
  directly. `ask` is never used: a question in a headless run has nobody to
  answer it, and `--auto`, which approves everything not explicitly denied, is
  deliberately not passed.
  Two things surfaced from testing that config rather than reading about it.
  `write` is a real tool but is **not** among the permission keys in OpenCode's
  published schema, so it must be granted explicitly or the agent cannot create
  the one file the workflow treats as proof it finished. And a `"*": "deny"`
  catch-all — which looked like obvious hardening — resolved *before* the
  command rules on one machine and *after* them on another, where last-match-wins
  would have let it silently override the entire allowlist; pinning the OpenCode
  version achieves what it was meant to without depending on rule order. The
  config now resolves identically whether or not a global `~/.config/opencode`
  config exists, which is the property that makes a local rehearsal mean
  anything.
  The turn limit is `steps` in that config; OpenCode has no `--max-turns`. On
  exhaustion it forces a text-only response, so the agent cannot write a
  verdict, so the run fails loudly — the same outcome as Claude Code running out
  of turns, reached by a different route.
  **Which provider is used is configuration, not code.** OpenCode reaches every
  provider it knows about through that provider's own environment variable, so
  the *name* of the variable is `AGENT_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ENV` (default
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and the value is a single `AGENT_OPENCODE_API_KEY` secret.
  Pointing a repository at a different provider, a self-hosted gateway or a
  proxy is then two repository settings rather than a YAML edit repeated in
  every generated project and shipped through a template release — the same
  reasoning the `AI_MODELS` list was built on, applied to the engine. A custom
  or self-hosted endpoint additionally takes a `provider` block with a
  `baseURL` in the OpenCode config; no workflow change is needed for that
  either. The name is validated before use, because a typo would otherwise
  surface as an OpenCode failure rather than as the settings mistake it is.
  **Configuration:** `AGENT_ENGINE`, the `AGENT_OPENCODE_API_KEY` secret, and
  optionally `AGENT_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ENV` and `AGENT_OPENCODE_VERSION`;
  `AGENT_OPENCODE_MODEL` names the model and has no default.
  The model default is chosen for context rather than price — the prompt invites
  the agent to open the full log, which is capped at 400 KB and tokenises to far
  more than a small window holds, so a cheaper model with a 128K context would
  serve every ordinary run and fail on exactly the unfamiliar failure the full
  log exists for. The secret scan covers `AGENT_OPENCODE_API_KEY` alongside
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and scans both whichever engine ran, so adding an engine
  cannot quietly leave a key unscanned; because it matches the secret's value
  rather than a variable name, it keeps working whatever provider that value was
  handed to.

- **An agent reviews pull requests, and is trusted with nothing** —
  `ai-review.yml` reads the diff of a pull request opened from a branch in this
  repository and leaves one comment, updated in place on each push rather than
  added to. It uses the same three-job split as the repair workflow and for the
  same reason: the agent job holds no credential, not even one that could write
  a comment, and the job that publishes runs no agent.
  **It gates nothing, deliberately.** Published measurements of adversarially
  filtered LLM review put roughly four in five candidate findings in the
  false-positive bin, and one reported case had ten independent reviewers
  unanimously confirm a vulnerability that did not exist — killed only by
  running a test. So the reviewer has no way to say "approved": it emits
  findings or it emits none, and the absence of findings is the absence of
  findings rather than an endorsement. What decides whether a change is sound is
  the four-platform matrix and the lint gates, exactly as before. Before this is
  wired to anything that can block a merge, its false-positive rate should be
  measured by replaying merged pull requests through it — that number, not the
  catch rate, is what decides whether it can gate, because a blocker that cries
  wolf turns "automatic" into "automatic unless a model got fussy".
  **It never sees a bot's account of the diff before forming its own.** When the
  pull request was opened by automation, its title and description are simply not
  written to disk: that text is prose another model wrote to explain this same
  change, and reading it first produces a review of the explanation. A person's
  description is included, because an account of intent is context rather than a
  claim to audit. The prompt spends as much space on what *not* to report —
  anything `make format-check`, `make analyze ARGS="--fatal-infos"` or
  `make rust-clippy` already enforces, style, taste, ungrounded speculation — as
  on what to look for, since noise is what makes a reviewer stop being read.
  **The reviewer is strictly read-only**, with no tool that can write, edit or
  patch a file and no shell at all, and it reports through its reply rather than
  by leaving a file behind. That was forced by measurement: across seven runs the
  model this repository runs never called the write tool once, reaching instead
  for patch application, and denied that it produced a complete set of findings
  and then spent its remaining turns failing to save them. Reporting through the
  reply removes the need for any write permission, which makes "the reviewer does
  not change the repository" a property of the tool list rather than a promise —
  and the job asserts the working tree is untouched anyway. Both agents' resolved
  permissions are asserted against the engine before either runs, because a
  per-agent block in OpenCode is appended to the global one rather than replacing
  it, so a rule can read as narrower than it resolves.
  **What it publishes is checked, not copied.** The reply is cut out of the
  transcript by parsing rather than by pattern-matching a code fence, so a
  finding that quotes a fenced diff hunk no longer truncates the object and loses
  the whole review. Every finding is checked against the fields the prompt calls
  required, and one that is missing them is published with the omission printed
  beside it rather than as though it were whole; a severity the prompt does not
  define is read as blocking rather than quietly shown as a note. The list of
  files the reviewer claims to have read is cross-checked against the files it
  actually opened, and a claim the transcript does not support is removed and
  reported as removed — in the one clean control run, four of the six files it
  named had never been opened. Everything a model wrote is escaped before it
  reaches the comment, so a fence, a stray `</details>` or an `@`-mention in a
  quoted diff line cannot break out of its block or notify anybody.
  **Configuration:** none beyond the repair agent's. `REVIEW_AGENT_ENGINE`,
  `REVIEW_AGENT_CLAUDECODE_MODEL` and `REVIEW_AGENT_OPENCODE_MODEL` each fall
  back to the repair setting, so a repository that configured one agent has both;
  the separate variables exist so that running the reviewer on a different model
  family is a settings change, which is worth having because a reviewer drawn
  from the same family as the writer shares its blind spots. There is no comment
  trigger: `issue_comment` runs in the base repository's context with secrets,
  which is the classic pwn request, so review of somebody else's pull request is
  `workflow_dispatch` — the one manual trigger that already requires write
  access — and it takes a `dry_run` flag so a rehearsal does not comment on a
  real pull request. Fork pull requests are refused explicitly rather than left
  to fail for want of a key, and so are Dependabot's: GitHub runs those without
  access to a repository's secrets, so the reviewer would have no key, and the
  refusal is a named skip rather than a red run on every dependency bump. On the
  Claude Code engine, `REVIEW_ALLOWED_BOTS` names the bots whose pull requests
  may be reviewed — that engine refuses a non-human actor otherwise, and seven of
  the last eight pull requests here were opened by one. Every run writes what it
  decided to the job summary, since most runs of this workflow decide not to
  review and used to leave nothing but a green tick behind. The token that posts
  the comment is minted with one permission rather than with everything the
  App installation holds.

#### Changed

- **`make release-frb` no longer stamps its highlight into the middle of a
  sentence** (`scripts/src/release_frb.dart`) — `stampFrbHighlight` inserted the
  `**libsignal_frb vX.Y.Z**` line at `lastBullet + 1`, one line after the *first*
  line of the last Highlights bullet. A bullet that wraps continues on indented
  lines that do not start with `- `, so the stamp landed inside it and split the
  sentence in half. Every previous release happened to have a single-line
  highlight there, which is why this only surfaced on the v6.1.2 stamp — and it
  surfaced in a section a release is about to freeze, where it could not have
  been corrected afterwards. Everything between the last bullet and the end of
  the block belongs to that bullet, so the insert point is now the block's last
  non-blank line. The regression test fails against the old insert.

- **`make codegen` now uses the pinned generator** (`Makefile`) —
  `FRB_CODEGEN_VERSION` pins the binary that `make setup-frb-codegen` installs,
  but `codegen` did not depend on that target and ran whatever
  `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` happened to be on `PATH`. Regenerating with a
  different version rewrites the bindings and the `codegenVersion` they carry
  — the same drift the three pins exist to prevent, arriving through the one
  door they did not cover. Where CI already ran the two in sequence nothing
  changes: the prerequisite only reads `--version` when the pinned binary is
  already installed.

- **AI changelog: configurable provider list, replacing the retired GitHub
  Models** — GitHub Models was retired on 2026-07-30, taking `make
  update-changelog` and the CHANGELOG entry of `make update-template` with it.
  The replacement makes the model **operational configuration rather than
  code**: `AI_MODELS` holds an ordered `provider/model` list and the first
  entry that has a key and answers wins, so the next provider change is a
  repository-variable edit instead of a code change rolled out to every
  generated project through a template release — the exact cost this
  retirement imposed. **There is no default list**: with `AI_MODELS` unset
  nothing is called and the entry is simply not written, because a model that
  writes into this repository's CHANGELOG should be one somebody named rather
  than one the template picked. Keys without a list is a misconfiguration, not
  an opt-out, so that case warns instead of going quiet. Keys live one per
  provider (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`),
  forwarded step-scoped in both workflows so an org-level secret is not handed
  to the third-party actions in the same job.
  **`AI_MODELS_TOKEN` is gone.** It named no provider, so with one variable per
  provider there was nothing left for it to mean; it is removed from the
  scripts and from both workflows, and the secret can be deleted.
  **Action required:** set `AI_MODELS` and the per-provider keys before the
  next automated update runs — the old secret alone no longer writes anything.
  That case does not go quiet: keys present with no list is reported as a
  misconfiguration. `AI_EFFORT` tunes the cost/quality trade-off the same way.
- **The AI answer is now a provider-enforced JSON contract, and a partial one
  is never salvaged** — every provider is called through its own API
  (`scripts/src/ai_client.dart`) with a JSON schema it enforces, via
  `dart:io` rather than a `curl` subprocess: the HTTP status is what decides
  whether the next model is tried, and the key no longer sits in process
  arguments. A response that stops at the token limit or is refused is
  rejected *before* its content is read. Previously an unparseable answer was
  written into the `changed` field verbatim, which turned a malformed answer
  into a malformed CHANGELOG — a truncated response still contains a
  brace-delimited fragment that looks extractable. The next list entry is
  tried only when a model produced no answer at all (network, auth,
  rate-limit, server error, refusal, truncation); never on the *content* of
  an answer, which would make entries silently inconsistent, and never on a
  malformed request, so a bug in what is sent stays visible. Authentication is
  classified by response body as well as status — Google answers an invalid
  key with `400 API_KEY_INVALID` where Anthropic uses `401`, and reading that
  as a malformed request would halt the walk at a misconfigured first entry
  instead of falling through to the second.
- **An entry that calls a release breaking and harmless at once is refused** —
  a run labelled the removal of a `libsignal-protocol` helper `**BREAKING:**`
  and then closed with "these changes do not affect this library's public API".
  Only one can hold: a change is breaking *here* when it touches the surface
  this package exposes, not merely because it lands in a crate this package
  binds, and the helper in question sat in the second category. The prompt now
  separates those two conditions and says so, and the contradiction is checked
  in code before the entry is written, because it is decidable from the text and
  telling users a release is breaking when it is not is the expensive direction
  to be wrong in. Failing leaves the entry unwritten and the pull request
  labelled for a person, which is the path a malformed answer already took. The
  check normalises typographic apostrophes first — a model writing prose reaches
  for `’` whatever the example shows, and a check that a curly quote walks
  straight through is worse than none, because it reads as a guard.
- **OpenRouter is available as a third provider** — one key for many models, so
  trying a different model costs neither a code change nor a new secret. Because
  it is an aggregator its model half carries its own slash, which the entry
  parser already handled: `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-5`. Its API is
  OpenAI-shaped, which elsewhere is a deprecated side-door but here is the only
  interface it has, and it does support structured outputs. Two costs are worth
  knowing before putting it first: a third party sits on the path, and the
  schema guarantee is weaker — support is per model *and* per backing provider,
  and `strict` is enforced exactly by some and treated as guidance by others.
  There being no default list, nothing selects it implicitly: it enters the
  priority order only through an `AI_MODELS` edit.
  A route whose model cannot do structured outputs is rejected outright rather
  than silently downgraded, and OpenRouter's habit of reporting upstream
  failures as an `error` object inside an HTTP 200 is checked before the answer
  is read.
- **The API key cannot reach a log** — it is read from the environment and
  goes out in one request header per provider, never in a URL, in process
  arguments (the reason this moved off a `curl` subprocess), or in the prompt.
  Nothing logs it: the priority line prints model ids and variable *names*
  only. The one indirect path was the provider's own error body, which is
  quoted into logs and pull-request output — none of the three echo the key
  back, checked against a live rejection from each, but that is a property of
  their wording, so the key is now stripped from reported text regardless.
- **The entry now reports the codegen result instead of being barred from
  mentioning it** — the CHANGELOG step moved to after `Regenerate FRB
  bindings`, which records whether `lib/src/rust/` actually changed and passes
  it in as `--codegen unchanged|changed|not-run`. Given a result the model
  states it; given none it must stay silent on the subject. The same fact
  reaches the pull-request body, where it is the input to the stage-1 SemVer
  call: on a plain dependency bump `changed` is unexpected — codegen reads
  `rust/src/api`, which a bump does not touch — so it doubles as a tripwire for
  an upstream type this crate re-exports having moved.
- **The changelog prompt can no longer inherit a finding along with the style**
  — it is told to copy the house style but never a build result. Caught on the
  first live run: the model wrote "FRB bindings regenerate byte-for-byte
  identical", which it had no way to know — it ran no codegen, and the phrase
  came from earlier entries in the 150 lines of CHANGELOG it is given as a
  style reference. It was true this time because a human had checked it back
  then; on the first update where codegen *does* produce a diff, the same
  sentence would have been published as a falsehood. Its sibling prompt in
  `update_template` already forbade inventing verification; this one now does
  too.
- **The libsignal update PR is no longer the one PR that skips the test suite**
  — `test.yml` excluded `update-libsignal-*` branches, so the pull request whose
  entire payload is new native code was merged without the suite, clippy,
  `rust-test`, `cargo-deny`, the MSRV check or `verify-third-party-notices`
  running against it on any of the four platforms. Confirmed on the last real
  one (#57): fuzzing reported seven passing jobs and `test` reported
  *skipping*. The stated reason — the bump moves libsignal ahead of the
  published `libsignal_frb` binary — is already handled by the reusable
  workflow, which runs `make build` before `make test`; the build hook then
  finds `rust/target/release` and returns without downloading
  (`hook/build.dart`), and nothing caches `.dart_tool`, so the first hook run
  happens after that build. Update pull requests now cost a full matrix run,
  which is the point of them.
- **Pull requests now name the model that wrote the entry** — reported through
  `--ci-output` (`ai_provider=<provider/model>`) by both scripts. Without it a
  first provider that has quietly started failing shows up only as entries
  that drift in house style, months later.
- **Empty upstream release notes are named as such** — libsignal publishes
  every release with an empty body, so the prompt's release-notes section was
  blank, which reads to a model as "nothing changed" rather than "look at the
  commit list". Verified against the GitHub API across the last 15 releases.
- **`scripts/src/ai_client.dart` is covered by tests** — 48 cases over the
  list parsing, key resolution, the two schema shapes and all three response
  parsers, including the four that would otherwise corrupt a CHANGELOG
  silently: an answer behind a leading thinking block, a truncated response, a
  refusal, and Gemini reasoning parts flagged `thought`.
- **Adopted copier template v4.4.0 → v4.6.0** (`.copier-answers.yml`, and the
  files listed below) — two template releases at once, so most of this is
  arriving rather than being decided here.

  **`Check Template Updates` stops failing.** It has been red on every run since
  2026-08-16 — fifteen consecutive runs, one cause. `create-pull-request` begins
  with `git checkout -B <temp> HEAD`, and git refuses that while the index holds
  unmerged entries: `error: you need to resolve your current index first`. Its
  own `git add -A` comes later and is never reached, so a conflicted update
  counted the conflicts, wrote the draft body naming them, and then died on git
  — producing no pull request at all, which is the one outcome the workflow
  exists to report. The unmerged paths are now staged before the pull request is
  created, which is what the draft is for. The same workflow also installs
  protoc now: it runs `make rust-check` as one of the gates it reports, and
  without protoc `spqr`'s build script panics with ``Could not find `protoc` ``,
  so that row read **fail** on every update. It never turned a run red — the
  gates are deliberately non-fatal — which is worse, because a row that is
  always red is a row nobody reads.

  **The bind list moved out of the script**
  (`.github/agent-prompts/changelog-scope.md`, `scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`)
  — the "what this package binds and exposes" block that this repository added
  to its prompt is now a file the template creates once and never overwrites, so
  it can be edited without touching Dart and without conflicting on every
  template release. Moving it made room to say something the inline version left
  out: `spqr` reaches this package's users without being named anywhere in
  `lib/` or `rust/src/api/`, because it runs inside the Double Ratchet that
  *is* exposed. An upstream change to it satisfies neither condition in the
  prompt's rule 2 and is nevertheless user-visible, so the file says so
  explicitly.

  **`make verify-frb-pins`** (`scripts/verify_frb_pins.dart`, `Makefile`,
  `.github/workflows/`) — five files record the flutter_rust_bridge version and
  two of them are compared with `==` at runtime. The exact-range constraint above
  stops the resolver drifting; nothing stopped a person editing four of the five.
  The gate reads all five, rejects both a caret and the unpublishable bare form
  with the reason, and runs beside `verify-third-party-notices` on the Linux leg
  — five file reads, no build. It reads every occurrence rather than the first,
  because the first is not always the one that counts: a `dependency_overrides`
  entry replaces the dependency outright, a second pin in a `[target.'cfg(…)']`
  section resolves per target, and make takes a later `=` over an earlier `?=`. `.copier-answers.yml` joins the `test.yml` path
  filters, because a commit that edits only `frb_version` is exactly the commit
  that can put the pins out of step.

  **Dependabot watches `pub` and `cargo`** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — it
  watched only `github-actions`, which is one reason the flutter_rust_bridge
  break arrived as a silent resolve rather than a reviewable pull request.
  `flutter_rust_bridge` itself is ignored in both, because its version has to
  move in four places at once and a one-file pull request is wrong by
  construction; `make verify-frb-pins` catches that instead. The upstream crates are ignored under `cargo` for a different reason: Dependabot's cargo updater does follow git refs, so without that it would open its own pull request for the same bump `check-libsignal-updates.yml` exists to make — without codegen, the bindings tripwire, the CHANGELOG entry or the version badge.

  **Two floating dev inputs pinned, one left floating on purpose**
  (`pubspec.yaml`) — `pubspec.lock` is deliberately not committed for a library,
  so CI re-resolves on every run. `lints` is capped to one minor line because
  `make analyze ARGS="--fatal-infos"` turns any newly-added info-level lint into
  a build failure; this is precautionary rather than a live fix, since 6.1.0 is
  already published and was measured against this repository with nothing to
  report. `ffigen` keeps its `^20.1.1` floor, which the template now shares.
  `hooks` and `code_assets` stay on the caret: they define the protocol
  `hook/build.dart` implements and the SDK is the other half of it, so capping
  them below what the pinned Flutter expects breaks the hook at a consumer's
  build. The `test` job's Rust toolchain also stays `stable` while the MSRV job
  pins, and the asymmetry is now written down where a reader asks about it.

  **The App token is minted by Client ID** (`.github/workflows/`) —
  `actions/create-github-app-token@v3` deprecates `app-id`, and all six call
  sites now pass `client-id: ${{ vars.APP_CLIENT_ID }}`. This superseded the
  unmerged `chore/app-token-client-id` branch entirely — `pr-review.md`,
  `ai-review.yml` and `repair-build.yml` came out byte-identical to it and the
  other two files gained the same change plus what the template brought — so
  that branch and its worktree have been deleted.

  **Committing from a git worktree no longer breaks the pinned Flutter SDK**
  (`.githooks/pre-commit`) — arriving from the template, where the fix this
  repository made was ported. git exports an absolute `GIT_DIR` from a worktree,
  every child process inherits it, and `flutter` then reads the committing
  repository's HEAD to determine its own version and writes `0.0.0-unknown` into
  the shared SDK's version cache.

- **Dependabot no longer rewrites constraints it was told to leave alone** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — `pub`'s default versioning strategy is `widen`, "extend only the upper bound to include the new version", and it applies that across the whole manifest rather than only to what it is updating. The first run here opened a pull request whose four updates were `ffigen`, `lints`, `code_assets` and `hooks` — and which also rewrote `flutter_rust_bridge` from `">=2.12.0 <2.12.1"` to `^2.12.0`. That is the one constraint in this file that must not float: it is the exact regression that broke every consumer of the published package when flutter_rust_bridge 2.13.0 landed inside that caret. `lints`, `ffigen` and `hooks` were widened past bounds set on purpose as well.

  `ignore` is no defence, and it is worth being precise about why: it stops Dependabot opening a pull request *for* a dependency, not editing that dependency's constraint while it edits the file for other reasons. `flutter_rust_bridge` was ignored and rewritten anyway. `versioning-strategy: increase-if-necessary` fixes it — a constraint that already admits the new version is left alone, so a dependency nothing is updating stays untouched. `cargo` needs none of this: on the same run it changed exactly the one crate it was bumping and left every pin alone.

  `make verify-frb-pins` caught the rewrite on all four platforms before it could merge — its first real encounter, and what it exists for.

- **The `pub` and `cargo` groups take minor and patch only** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — grouping a major with everything else blocks the rest: one unmergeable entry takes the whole pull request down.

  It separates more than its name suggests, and the first run after the change is the evidence. Dependabot's commit trailers report a 0.x bump as `version-update:semver-minor`, but its *grouping* applies Cargo's own reading, where a 0.x minor is the breaking bump, and keeps them out of a `minor`+`patch` group anyway. The six-crate cargo group split into a group of two (`log` patch, `uuid` 1.x minor) plus one pull request each for `rand`, `sha2`, `hkdf` and `aes-gcm-siv` — the four that need a migration. Exactly the intended shape.

- **`dart-lang/setup-dart` 1.8.x is ignored, temporarily and narrowly** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — 1.8.0 added a problem matcher for `dart analyze` and registers it with `::add-matcher::dart-analyzer.json`. The path resolves against the *calling* action's directory, and this repository calls setup-dart from inside its own `setup-fvm` composite action, so the runner looks under `.github/actions/setup-fvm/`, does not find it, and fails the job fourteen seconds in, before anything is built. It failed that way on all four platforms.

  Only the 1.8 line is ignored, so 1.9.0 arrives for evaluation rather than this freezing the action; 1.8.1, the latest at the time of writing, does not fix it. The bump is worth little here in any case: setup-dart exists in that action solely to provide a `dart` binary for `dart pub global activate fvm` on the next line, and everything that builds and tests this package comes from the FVM-pinned SDK.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-08-15

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **Every Signal Protocol message type is now inspectable from Dart** — `PreKeySignalMessage`, `SenderKeyMessage`, `SenderKeyDistributionMessage` and `PlaintextContent` join `SignalMessage` and `DecryptionErrorMessage`. Messages could be produced and consumed but never read, which is why a group ciphertext's own `distributionId` had to be known out-of-band and a session's first post-quantum ratchet payload was unreachable ([#62](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/62))
- **`flutter test` works again for Flutter apps that depend on this package** ([#63](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/63)) — on macOS and Linux `LibSignal.init()` could not find the native library the build hook had just provisioned for the test runner, so a dependent package's own unit tests failed on a clean checkout while the app itself built and ran fine

- **Sealed sender gains content hints, group ids and multi-recipient fan-out** — `UnidentifiedSenderMessageContent` makes the sealed envelope itself addressable, so a recipient can learn whether an undecryptable message is worth a resend request without decrypting it; `sealedSenderMultiRecipientEncryptWithCallbacks` produces one Sealed Sender v2 message for a whole group

- **libsignal v0.101.0** — upstream's work this release is in zkgroup, zkcredential and the net/chat APIs; nothing moved in the crates this package binds
- **libsignal_frb v6.1.1** — Rust FFI bindings

- **New `PreKeySignalMessage` type** ([#62](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/62)) — `PreKeySignalMessage.deserialize(data: bytes)` plus `serialize()`, `messageVersion()`, `registrationId()`, `preKeyId()`, `signedPreKeyId()`, `kyberPreKeyId()`, `kyberCiphertext()`, `baseKey()`, `identityKey()`, `message()` and `cloneMessage()`. `message()` returns the wrapped `SignalMessage`, which is what makes a session's very first post-quantum ratchet payload readable: `PreKeySignalMessage.deserialize(data: ct).message().pqRatchet()`. Purely additive — nothing in the existing surface changed, and decryption still goes through `SessionCipher`, which owns the stores this type has no access to. As with `SignalMessage.deserialize`, parsing validates structure but does **not** authenticate: the inner MAC is only checked during decryption, so anything read off an un-decrypted message is attacker-controlled

- **New `SenderKeyMessage` and `SenderKeyDistributionMessage` types** — `distributionId()`, `chainId()`, `iteration()`, `messageVersion()`, plus `ciphertext()` and `verifySignature()` on the message and `signingKey()` on the distribution message. This is what lets a recipient derive the `distributionId` that `GroupCipher.decrypt` and `processDistributionMessage` require, instead of having to carry it alongside the ciphertext. The distribution message's **chain key is deliberately not exposed**: it is secret key material, there is no constructor to pair it with, and an accessor would only add a way to leak it

- **New `PlaintextContent` type** — `PlaintextContent.fromDecryptionErrorMessage(...)` builds the envelope a `DecryptionErrorMessage` travels in, which previously could be parsed from an incoming message but not produced, leaving the retry-receipt flow half-implemented. Note `DecryptionErrorMessage.extractFromSerializedContent` takes `body()`, not `serialize()` — it rejects the leading identifier byte

- **New `UnidentifiedSenderMessageContent` type and `ContentHint` enum** — build the inner payload of a sealed sender message yourself to set a content hint (`none`/`resendable`/`implicit`, with unknown values passed through) and a group id, then seal it with `sealedSenderEncryptFromUsmcWithCallbacks`. `sealedSenderDecryptToUsmcWithCallbacks` goes the other way: it returns the envelope **without** decrypting the message inside, which is how a client reads the hint for a message it cannot decrypt. It requires `trustRoot`, `timestamp`, `localName`, `localDeviceId` and `getIdentity`, and runs all three of the checks that stand between `SealedSenderCipher.decrypt` and its plaintext — see Security below. An empty group id is omitted from the serialized form, so it reads back as absent after a round trip

- **Sealed Sender v2 multi-recipient encryption** — `sealedSenderMultiRecipientEncryptWithCallbacks` encrypts one `UnidentifiedSenderMessageContent` for many destinations at once, producing the single *SentMessage* blob a server fans out; `sealedSenderV2ParseSentMessage` reads that blob so it can be split per recipient, returning each recipient's service id, devices with their registration ids, and the **offsets** of that recipient's message within the blob. `SealedSenderV2SentMessage.receivedMessageFor(recipient:, data:)` assembles one recipient's ready-to-deliver message from them — one at a time, so the shared body is never copied per recipient. Excluded recipients are listed with no payload. Sessions are read but never advanced, so nothing needs storing. Two constraints the single-recipient path does not have: destination address names must be service ids (a bare UUID or `PNI:<uuid>`), and destination registration ids must fit in 14 bits (0..=16383). Identities are resolved through `getIdentity` and an unknown one is refused rather than trusted on first use — per contiguous run of destinations sharing an address name, from the run's first destination, which is what Sealed Sender v2's per-account key material requires. Group each account's devices together in the list and the behaviour is uniform; [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#identity-trust--mitm-detection) has the table

- **libsignal v0.100.0 → v0.101.0** — nothing upstream changed in the surface this package binds. Across the whole range, the only file touched in `libsignal-protocol`, `libsignal-core` and `signal-crypto` is `rust/core/src/version.rs`, the version constant itself; `make codegen` agrees, producing byte-identical bindings. Upstream's work went to zkgroup (`GenericServerSecretParams` and `GenericServerPublicParams` drop `serde::Deserialize` in favour of `TryFrom<&[u8]>`, and call-link credentials now record which params version issued them), zkcredential, and the typed net/chat APIs (`submitCallQualitySurvey()`, `AuthUsernamesService.confirmUsername()`) — none of which this package exposes. The BoringSSL bump that comes with it (boring-rs v5.2.0) does not reach the binary either: `boring` is not in this crate's dependency graph at all. The remaining lockfile movement is patch-level transitive bumps

#### Security

- **`sealedSenderDecryptToUsmc` now checks identity trust, not just the certificate chain** — it validated the sender certificate against the trust root but never compared the identity key that certificate carries against the one stored for that sender, while its doc comment claimed parity with `SealedSenderCipher.decrypt`. A certificate that chains to the trust root but binds a *different* identity key was unsealed and reported as that sender, silently — where the decrypt path refuses the identical message with `untrusted identity`. The everyday form of this needs no attacker at all: a peer who re-registers gets a valid certificate carrying a new identity key, which is a safety-number change, and a caller using the envelope to decide who to send a resend request to would never have seen it. The function now takes a **`getIdentity` callback** and applies the same rule as everywhere else in the bridge — nothing stored is first use and is accepted, a stored identity must match — raising the same `untrusted identity` error. Order is enforced too: the certificate chain is checked *before* the store is consulted, so an unvalidated (attacker-chosen) sender name can never drive a store lookup. **Action required:** pass `getIdentity` — the same callback you already give `sealedSenderDecryptWithCallbacks`. This changes the signature announced in [#62](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/62); nothing on pub.dev shipped with the old one

- **`sealedSenderV2ParseSentMessage` no longer amplifies its input** — it built each recipient's message as its own byte array, and since every recipient's message ends with the same shared body, output grew as roughly `recipients × message size`: a 570 KB input measured at 1 GB of output, an amplification that rises with the square of the input. It now returns `keyMaterialStart`/`keyMaterialEnd` per recipient plus one `sharedBytesOffset`, which is `O(recipients)` whatever the body size, and `SealedSenderV2SentMessage.receivedMessageFor` builds a single recipient's message on demand. This is also how libsignal expects a fan-out server to work — `range_for_recipient_key_material` and `offset_of_shared_bytes` exist for it. A message larger than `u32::MAX` is now rejected rather than having its offsets truncated. **Action required:** replace `recipient.receivedMessage` with `parsed.receivedMessageFor(recipient: recipient, data: theSameBytes)`

- **Sealed sender now detects a self-send, on both paths** — upstream's `sealed_sender_decrypt` refuses a message whose sender certificate names the receiving device, so a server that reflects your own sealed message back at you cannot have you process it as incoming. This package rebuilds that function out of its parts rather than calling it, and the check was lost on the way: `sealedSenderDecryptWithCallbacks` unsealed and decrypted such a message, and `sealedSenderDecryptToUsmcWithCallbacks` unsealed it and reported *you* as the sender — enough for a caller to aim a resend request at itself. Both now raise `self send of a sealed sender message`, before any store is touched. The check compares the service id and the device id, so another device of your own account is unaffected. **Action required:** `sealedSenderDecryptToUsmcWithCallbacks` takes **`localName` and `localDeviceId`**, the same two `sealedSenderDecryptWithCallbacks` already took. `sealedSenderDecryptWithCallbacks` is unchanged in shape

- **Secrets now survive a panicking store callback** — a Dart store callback that throws unwinds the Rust worker thread (Flutter Rust Bridge declares these callbacks non-failable), and every secret in the sealed-sender path was cleared by a `zeroize()` written *after* the work, which that unwind skips. A production `IdentityKeyStore.getIdentity` over a locked database was enough to leave an identity key pair — and, for a multi-recipient send, every destination's `SessionRecord` — in freed memory. Clearing is now tied to `Drop` (`Zeroizing`, and a guard around the destination list), so it happens on return, on error and on unwind alike. The `SessionRecord` loaded during a sealed-sender decrypt, which was never zeroized at all, is covered too

- **`SealedSenderV2SentMessage.receivedMessageFor` rejects a buffer that is not the parsed one** — it documented that it throws when `data` does not match the parsed message, but only checked that the offsets fit. A buffer merely *longer* than the parsed blob was accepted and the shared run silently extended, so the delivered message grew a tail the blob never had. The parse result now carries **`parsedLength`** and any other length is refused. A *different* buffer of the *same* length still cannot be told apart — the doc now says that outright rather than implying otherwise. `data` is also `List<int>` now, matching every other byte parameter in the generated API

#### Fixed

- **`LibSignal.init()` now works under `flutter test`** ([#63](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/63)) — the build hook registers the native library as a `CodeAsset`, but a `package:` asset id is not a path: it cannot be `dlopen`ed, and Dart offers no way to ask for a registered asset's file location, so the library has to be found on disk. Only the `dart run`/`dart test` and AOT-bundle locations were probed. `flutter test` installs the very same hooked library under `build/native_assets/<os>/` and never creates `.dart_tool/lib/`, so on macOS and Linux the unit tests of every Flutter package depending on `libsignal` failed in `LibSignal.init()` on a clean tree, while the app itself built and ran fine. Windows resolved it by accident: flutter_tools prepends that directory to the test runner's `PATH`, which is where Windows looks for a DLL. A leftover `.dart_tool/lib/` from a previous `dart test` was what made it look intermittent. That directory is now probed too — **last**, after the AOT bundle, so a library that happens to sit in the working directory can never shadow the one a compiled application shipped with. **Workaround on older versions:** pass the path explicitly, e.g. `LibSignal.init(libraryPath: 'build/native_assets/macos/liblibsignal_frb.dylib')` (`.../linux/liblibsignal_frb.so` on Linux)

- **A sender key distribution message processed under the wrong distribution id is now refused instead of silently dropped** — `GroupCipher.processDistributionMessage` takes the distribution id from the caller, but a `SenderKeyDistributionMessage` also carries one, and libsignal stores the new sender-key state under the id *inside* the message. When the two disagreed the state was written to a key the wrapper never reads back. On first contact that surfaced as an error, but when a record already existed under the caller's id the read-back returned that stale record, so the call **succeeded** while discarding the distribution message — the group's later messages then failed to decrypt with a misleading "Process a distribution message first." The ids are now compared up front and a mismatch throws `Distribution ID mismatch: message carries <x>, caller passed <y>`. The matching-id path is unchanged. `GroupCipher.decrypt` was already fail-closed on the same mismatch and is untouched

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **Native-asset probe-order coverage** — `test/platform/native_asset_search_paths_test.dart` pins that the `flutter test` install directory is in the probe list, spelled as a per-host literal rather than by recomputing the implementation's own `Platform.operatingSystem` expression, and that it stays *behind* the AOT bundle. Nothing in `make test` could have caught [#63](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/63) — `dart test` always resolves through `.dart_tool/lib/`, so the first probe wins there. The only end-to-end guard would be a `flutter test` leg over `example/`, which does not exist yet

- **`PreKeySignalMessage` test coverage** — `test/protocol/prekey_signal_message_test.dart` covers the serialize round-trip, every accessor against the keys the session was actually built from, that inspecting a message does not consume it, and that malformed input (including a bare `SignalMessage`) is rejected

- **Distribution-id mismatch coverage** — `test/groups/distribution_id_mismatch_test.dart` pins the refusal in both branches (with and without an existing record) and that two independent groups still round-trip

- **Coverage for the new message and sealed-sender types** — `test/groups/sender_key_message_inspection_test.dart`, `test/protocol/plaintext_content_test.dart` and `test/sealed_sender/usmc_and_multi_recipient_test.dart`, including a full multi-recipient round trip where two recipients each unseal their own message, and the refusal of an untrusted destination

- **Differential tests for the Sealed Sender v2 fan-out** — `rust/src/ssv2_equivalence_tests.rs` (run by `make rust-test`, and by CI) puts a corpus of crafted SentMessages plus a real multi-recipient message through both this package's parser and libsignal's, and asserts the message Dart reassembles from the returned offsets is **byte-identical** to `received_message_parts_for_recipient`. Moving that assembly out of Rust is the one place in this release where logic was rewritten rather than added, and nothing else pins it: an upstream change to the SentMessage layout would otherwise surface as multi-recipient messages quietly failing to decrypt. The same file sweeps every truncation and a few thousand byte mutations for panics, and pins that its own comparison can fail

- **Identity-trust regression coverage for the sealed-sender envelope** — `test/sealed_sender/decrypt_to_usmc_identity_trust_test.dart` runs `sealedSenderDecryptToUsmc` and `SealedSenderCipher.decrypt` against the *same* forged-certificate message and requires both to refuse it, pins trust-on-first-use for an unknown sender, and asserts the `getIdentity` callback is never reached when the certificate chain fails. Its absence is what let the gap ship. `usmc_and_multi_recipient_test.dart` gains the fan-out reconstruction properties and a case pinning that an unknown destination identity is refused per contiguous run rather than per device

- **SPQR progress regression test** — `test/protocol/spqr_ratchet_progress_test.dart` runs a 200-round-trip alternating conversation and decodes the epoch and payload type out of each `SignalMessage.pqRatchet()` frame instead of measuring its length. Every chunk-bearing SPQR frame is the same ~37 bytes (the encoder chunks all ML-KEM material at 32 bytes), so length says nothing about progress; the epoch does. The test asserts both sides pass epoch 1 — which requires a full ML-KEM encapsulation to have completed across ~400 store round-trips per side — and that the responder answers with `Ct1` on exactly its third send, i.e. as soon as the third header chunk has arrived, pinning that the PreKey decrypt path applies and persists its inbound SPQR chunk — chunk 0 of that header is read straight off the PreKey message through the new `PreKeySignalMessage.message()`. A second case pins the responder's 4-byte `None` frames while the header is still incomplete as expected behaviour (reported as [#62](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/62))

#### Changed

- **`TestParty` moved to `test/test_helpers/test_party.dart`** — it lived inside `session_cipher_test.dart` and was already being imported across test files; it is now a proper helper library alongside `session_helpers.dart`

## [7.0.2] - 2026-08-08

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **libsignal v0.100.0** — dependency update only: the single change reaching the crates this package binds removes a helper this library never called, and the FFI surface regenerates byte-for-byte identical
- **libsignal_frb v6.0.2** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **libsignal native library → v0.100.0** ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.99.3...v0.100.0))
  - The range covers two upstream releases. **v0.99.4** — upstream's own summary is "SVRB: 2026Q1 to previous", "SGX: Enforce TCB number in evidence" and "Backups: Validate the new `blockedAtTimestamp` field on Contact and Group" — lands entirely in `rust/net`, `rust/attest` and `rust/message-backup`, alongside a `LogSafeDisplay` for `socks::Protocol` and the Java/Kotlin binding generators. None of that is exposed by this library, and in the three crates this package binds (`libsignal-protocol`, `signal-crypto`, `libsignal-core`) its only diff is the `VERSION` constant
  - **v0.100.0** is the minor bump, and the one release in range that touches a bound crate. Upstream summarises it as "SPQR: Remove requirePqRatio argument for sessions, instead requiring for all sessions". Concretely, `should_use_nonpq_session()` is deleted from `libsignal-protocol` along with its re-export and its test — the helper that decided, from a server-supplied ratio, which non-post-quantum sessions to keep and which to archive during the post-quantum ratchet rollout — and upstream's own `SessionRecord_HasUsableSenderChain` bridge drops the matching `requirePqRatio` argument, so it now always demands `NotStale | EstablishedWithPqxdh | Spqr`
  - **The removal does not reach this package.** It never called or exposed `should_use_nonpq_session`: choosing a migration ratio is an application's policy question rather than a protocol binding's, and `SessionRecord.hasUsableSenderChain()` here is this package's own FRB binding, which never carried the argument upstream has now dropped. The release build is clean and `make codegen` reproduces `lib/src/rust/` byte-for-byte, so the FFI surface is unchanged and the binding's signature is the same on both sides
  - Also in range but out of reach: `UnauthBackupsService.listBackupMedia`, a new typed API in the `rust/net` chat layer this package does not bind, and a zkgroup fix that stops invalid curve points being treated as candidate profile keys — `zkgroup` is not in this package's dependency graph at all
  - Upstream prepared a v0.99.5 that was never tagged, which is why two releases span three version numbers
  - Both upstream GitHub releases carry an **empty** body; the summaries quoted above come from upstream's in-repo `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and the per-crate analysis is derived from the commit range
  - Transitively, the shipped binary picks up `libsignal-debug` 0.99.3 → 0.100.0, `zerocopy` 0.8.55 → 0.8.56, and `data-encoding` 2.11.0 → 2.11.1 with its `data-encoding-macro` 0.1.20 → 0.1.21 wrapper. `zerocopy-derive`, `data-encoding-macro-internal` and `delegate-attr` move as well but are proc-macros, and `aho-corasick` 1.1.4 → 1.1.5 and `regex-automata` 0.4.16 → 0.4.18 enter the graph only through `prost-build`, a build-dependency of `libsignal-protocol` and `spqr` — so none of those five reach the binary. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` is regenerated to match

## [7.0.1] - 2026-08-03

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **libsignal v0.99.3** — dependency update only: nothing in the libsignal crates this package links changed beyond added tests and version strings, and the FFI surface regenerates byte-for-byte identical
- **libsignal_frb v6.0.1** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **libsignal native library → v0.99.3** ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.99.1...v0.99.3))
  - Upstream work across v0.99.2 and v0.99.3 targets the chat/backup transport, key transparency, the SVR2 enclaves and their attestation, a PNI-less zkgroup `AuthCredential` API, and the Node/Java/TypeScript bindings — none of which this library exposes
  - Of the crates from that repository which reach the binary — the three this package binds (`libsignal-protocol`, `signal-crypto`, `libsignal-core`) plus the transitive `libsignal-debug` — the only source change in either release is two added `#[test]` functions covering HPKE invalid inputs in `signal-crypto`; everything else is the `VERSION` constant. The FRB bindings regenerate byte-for-byte identical, so the FFI surface is unchanged
  - Neither upstream release published release notes, so this entry is derived from the commit range rather than from a changelog
  - Transitively, the shipped binary picks up `aes` 0.9.1 → 0.9.2 and `hybrid-array` 0.4.13 → 0.4.14 (the RustCrypto array crate `aes` is built on). `cc`, `clang-sys`, `displaydoc`, `either` and `toml_parser` also move, but reach this crate only as build-dependencies or through proc-macro subtrees, so none of them ship. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` is regenerated to match

- **Encryption of store contents at rest is documented** — every record a store persists serializes with its private key material included, and the library holds no key to encrypt it with: it is a pure Dart package with no platform-channel access, so it cannot reach Keychain, Android Keystore, DPAPI or libsecret, and on the web no key source exists that does not require a passphrase each session. A new `SECURITY.md` section gives the sealed-store pattern on the already-public `Aes256GcmSiv` + `hkdfDerive` — KEK installed once as an opaque handle, AAD bound to the slot being read, nonce rules and why GCM-SIV rather than GCM, a format version byte — plus a per-platform table of where the KEK comes from and an explicit statement that this protects against an attacker who reads your storage, not one executing code in your process

### For Contributors

#### Changed

- **`.fvmrc` no longer drifts on every `make codegen`** — `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` shells out to `fvm install`, and `fvm install` rewrites `.fvmrc` and `.vscode/settings.json` whenever they are not already byte-identical to what it would emit. The committed files were not: fvm orders the keys `flutter, flavors, runPubGetOnSdkChanges, updateVscodeSettings, updateGitIgnore` and writes **no trailing newline**, and it rewrites `dart.flutterSdkPath` to the version-pinned `.fvm/versions/<v>`. So every codegen run left two modified files behind, and the nightly libsignal-update workflow — which runs codegen and then `create-pull-request` without `add-paths` — swept them into its PR commits. `.fvmrc` is now committed in fvm's own serialization with `updateVscodeSettings: false`, which makes `fvm install` a byte-level no-op on both files; verified by running `make codegen` and comparing checksums. fvm writes the file with Dart's `JsonEncoder.withIndent('  ')` + `writeAsStringSync`, which emits LF and no trailing newline on every platform, so `.fvmrc` is also marked `-text` in `.gitattributes` — otherwise a Windows checkout under the default `core.autocrlf=true` gets CRLF, never matches, and is silently rewritten on every install. `.vscode/settings.json` deliberately keeps `.fvm/flutter_sdk` rather than fvm 4's version-pinned path: the symlink is still created by fvm 4, so it works on fvm 2, 3 and 4 alike, while `.fvm/versions/3.38.4` breaks for anyone on fvm 2.x and needs editing on every Flutter bump. Leaving the file to fvm was the worse option in any case — where fvm has no privileged access (Windows without Developer Mode, where it also creates neither symlink) it writes an **absolute, machine-local** SDK path into this committed file. The one cost is a `[WARN] You are using VSCode, but fvm is not managing VSCode settings` line on each install; do not "fix" it by removing the setting

- **The pre-commit hook reports a missing toolchain as a missing toolchain** — any failure of step 1 was announced as `Formatting check failed. Run 'make format'`, so a hook run from an IDE or GUI git client — which inherits a minimal PATH and cannot find `fvm`, `make` or `cargo` — sent you looking at your code instead of your PATH. The hook now appends the usual install locations before the first check — appended rather than prepended so a tool deliberately placed earlier in PATH keeps winning, and covering both the Unix (`~/.pub-cache/bin`) and the Windows/Git-Bash (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin`) pub-cache layouts, honouring `PUB_CACHE` / `CARGO_HOME`, and adding only directories that exist. It then checks `make`, `fvm` and `cargo` are present up front, and distinguishes exit 127 from a genuine check failure so a broken environment is never reported as a code problem. Both the old and new hooks are `shellcheck` clean

- **`Discard FVM config changes` in `setup-fvm` is documented as a guard, not a fix** — a step in a composite action can only clean up after that action, while `fvm install` also runs later in the job from inside `make codegen`, so its position was never the defect. Comment only; the config change above is the actual fix

- **`make setup-repo-protections` now turns on automatic head-branch deletion** — the script applied rulesets and the `native-build` environment but never touched repo settings, so `delete_branch_on_merge` sat at GitHub's default of off and every merged branch stayed forever; 42 `update-libsignal-*` branches had accumulated since v0.86.10 (deleted, and each is still reachable through its pull request's `refs/pull/<n>/head`). `delete-branch: true` on `peter-evans/create-pull-request` does not cover this — it only removes branches the action itself closes as obsolete. The script now also sends `PATCH repos/<slug>` with `delete_branch_on_merge=true`, warning rather than failing when it cannot. Note that GitHub performs the deletion as whoever merged the pull request, so the `Delete branches` ruleset confines it to that ruleset's bypass actors (repository admins here); for anyone else it quietly does nothing, which leaves the branch exactly where the setting being off would have left it

- **A mistyped signing passphrase no longer aborts a release, and an interrupted one is resumed by re-running the same command** — `git` signs a commit or a tag by shelling out to `ssh-keygen -Y sign`, which reads the passphrase exactly once and calls `fatal()` on a failed load rather than re-prompting. One typo therefore killed the release wherever it happened, and the position that hurts is *between* the commit and the tag, because that state blocks its own recovery: the version bump is committed, no tag exists, and re-running trips the "must be greater than the current version" precondition. Both stages now route every signing and push step through `runInheritRetry`, which prints the failure and runs the step again, so the prompt simply comes back the way `ssh` and `sudo` behave — **Ctrl-C is the way out**, which works because `inheritStdio` delivers the interrupt to the whole foreground process group. The loop is uncapped (an attempt limit would reinstate the failure it exists to prevent), a non-interactive stdin throws on the first failure so CI behaviour is unchanged — tested via `stdin.echoMode`, deliberately not `hasTerminal`, which calls a run redirected from `/dev/null` interactive — and from the third consecutive failure it paces itself at two seconds so a step failing in milliseconds cannot scroll past faster than it can be read. `alreadyDone` is consulted after a failure so a step whose effect already landed reports success instead of being attempted twice, and `beforeRetry` re-stages the release files before each commit retry, because our own pre-commit hook runs `make rust-check`, whose `cargo check` rewrites `rust/Cargo.lock` when the crate version moved. Separately, a Ctrl-C or a closed terminal is now recognised: `isResumableRelease` requires *all* of a clean tree, the version file already reading exactly the requested version, and `HEAD`'s subject equal to the exact subject the release writes (held in one `commitSubject` variable passed both to `git commit -m` and to the predicate, so the two cannot drift apart), and a leftover tag is accepted only when it is this release's tag *and* points at `HEAD`. Interrupting *before* the commit is the one case nothing can report at the time, so the "working tree is not clean" error now uses `onlyTheseFilesDirty` to name the single `git restore` that discards the release's own edits — declining to suggest one for an untracked path or a rename, where the command would not work or would take something else with it. Covered by a new `test/scripts/release_common_test.dart` (13 cases over both predicates); the retry loop's own I/O is driven by a terminal by construction and was verified against a pty upstream instead

- **copier template adopted: v4.1.0 → v4.2.0** — three of the five commits in this range are the template's adoption of fixes made here first (the `.fvmrc` / `.vscode/settings.json` drift, the pre-commit hook's PATH handling, and `delete_branch_on_merge`), and all three came back byte-identical, so `copier update` left those files untouched. The template's fourth fix — that its `pre-commit` hook shipped mode 644 and therefore never ran in a generated project — never applied here: this repo's hook has been 755 since it was added. What actually lands is the release-script work above, plus two documentation carriers for a decision this repo already made: `.vscode/settings.json` gains the header explaining why it is committed and why `fvm install`'s "remove `updateVscodeSettings: false`" warning must not be acted on, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains an *Editor Setup (FVM)* section saying the same for contributors, including the note that Windows needs Developer Mode before the first `fvm install` for the `.fvm/flutter_sdk` symlink `dart.flutterSdkPath` points at. Adopting the release-script change now is deliberate: no release is in flight, so unlike the v3.0.2 adoption it cannot alter the behaviour of a run already under way

- **copier template adopted: v4.2.0 → v4.3.0** — the template now applies its own updates instead of only announcing them: `make update-template` (`scripts/update_template.dart`, `scripts/src/update_template.dart`, and a `test/scripts/update_template_test.dart` covering the unmerged-path parser and the CHANGELOG insertion) runs `copier update`, reports what it could not merge, and files the adoption entry; the scheduled workflow runs it and opens a pull request carrying the result, the way the libsignal update workflow already does. It reports two failure modes separately because both are quiet: conflicts leave both sides in the file and make the pull request a **draft** — nothing else catches them, since `format-check`, `rust-check` and `analyze` read only Dart and Rust while copier's conflicts land in Markdown — and `.copier-answers.yml` failing to move `_commit` fails the job *after* the pull request exists, because that state merges as an un-updated project and re-opens the same pull request forever. Copier is pinned (`copier==9.11.1`, `jinja2-strcase==0.0.2`) for the reason the actions are pinned by SHA: this runs unattended, and a copier release that changed how it merges would arrive as a conflict-shaped diff rather than a clean failure. The gates the pre-commit hook runs are executed and reported in the pull request body but never enforced — a template update that breaks a gate is precisely the one a human most needs to see

  Also fixed: **the `git restore` hint added in v4.2.0 never fired.** The release scripts read `git status --porcelain` through `git()`, which trims its output; the two status columns are positional, so an unstaged modification is `' M path'`, and trimming ate the leading space of the *first* line and shifted that path by one character. `onlyTheseFilesDirty` then matched nothing and rejected the whole status, so every interrupted release got the generic "working tree is not clean" instead — in exactly the case the hint was written for, because a release edits its files without staging them. Both scripts now read the status through a `gitStatus()` that strips only trailing newlines, and a test pins the two shapes against each other so a future trim cannot pass unnoticed. This is why the update was taken before the release rather than after it

  The fourth commit in the range releases the template repository itself and touches nothing under `template/`, so it does not reach here. `copier update` produced no conflicts and no `.rej` files, and `_commit` landed on v4.3.0 unaided; none of this repository's standing divergences (`fuzz.yml`, `SECURITY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`'s two-stage Release Flow, the rulesets' populated bypass actor, `scripts/src/update_changelog.dart`'s project-specific prompt) were in range — `CLAUDE.md` took a single new line in its command list

## [7.0.0] - 2026-07-30

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **Kyber pre-keys are marked used on every decryption path, with libsignal's full argument list** — **(breaking)** closes a gap where `SealedSenderCipher.decrypt` consumed a Kyber pre-key without ever telling the store, and widens `KyberPreKeyStore.markKyberPreKeyUsed` to the three arguments libsignal's own store trait receives, so last-resort anti-replay becomes implementable
- **Pre-key consumption follows libsignal instead of guessing at it** — a redelivered pre-key message no longer re-consumes the one-time keys libsignal deliberately left alone, and the session is now persisted *after* those writes, so a crash between the two cannot leave a one-time pre-key usable forever
- **Store durability, write ordering and rollback are a documented contract** — every store interface and cipher, plus a new `SECURITY.md` section, now state what your implementation has to guarantee. This corrects rather than extends the previous advice: a lock *inside* the store leaves `load → ratchet → store` unprotected, so two concurrent `encrypt` calls for one address derive the same message key
- **`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` ships with the package** — the prebuilt native library is statically linked against its Rust dependency tree, and those licences require the notices to travel with a binary, including an application that embeds it. Signal's own AGPL-3.0-only crates are named there alongside the permissive majority
- **libsignal v0.99.1** — unchanged this release
- **libsignal_frb v6.0.0** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed (Breaking)

- **`KyberPreKeyStore.markKyberPreKeyUsed` now takes the signed pre-key ID and the sender's base key** — the signature changes from `markKyberPreKeyUsed(int kyberPreKeyId)` to `markKyberPreKeyUsed(int kyberPreKeyId, int signedPreKeyId, PublicKey baseKey)`, mirroring libsignal's `KyberPreKeyStore::mark_kyber_pre_key_used`. Previously only the Kyber ID reached Dart, so the last-resort check that trait documents ("check whether the same combination of pre-keys was used with the given base key before") was impossible for a consumer to implement — the data simply never arrived. **Action required:** update your `KyberPreKeyStore` implementation to the new signature. Retiring a *one-time* key still only needs `kyberPreKeyId`; for a *last-resort* key, record the `(kyberPreKeyId, signedPreKeyId, baseKey)` triple and treat a repeat as a replayed pre-key message. See `KyberPreKeyStore.markKyberPreKeyUsed` and limitation 5 in `SECURITY.md` for what a detected repeat can and cannot do

- **`SealedSenderDecryptResult.preKeyToRemove` removed** — only affects callers of the raw generated API (`sealedSenderDecryptWithCallbacks`); `SealedSenderCipher.decrypt` is unchanged for its users. Sealed-sender decryption now takes `removePreKey` and `markKyberPreKeyUsed` callbacks, which the bridge invokes itself in libsignal's order, rather than returning an ID for the caller to act on afterwards — matching how `SessionCipher.decrypt` has always worked. **Action required:** if you call the raw function, pass the two new callbacks and delete your post-call `removePreKey` handling

#### Changed

- **The package ships `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`** — the prebuilt native library is statically linked against its Rust dependency tree, and those licences require their notices to travel with a binary distribution, including an application that embeds the library. Flutter's `LicenseRegistry` does not cover them: it aggregates `LICENSE` files of pub packages, and Rust crates are not pub packages. The file sits at the package root and is generated from the resolved dependency graph with no platform filtering at all, so the same commit yields the same file on any machine — build edges are included because that is how vendored native code reaches the binary — and CI verifies it stays in sync with `Cargo.lock`. It is not an inventory of permissive licences: Signal's own crates in that graph (`libsignal-protocol`, `libsignal-core`, `signal-crypto` and their siblings) are AGPL-3.0-only, and they are named alongside the MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD / ISC majority, with the README's new *Third-party notices* section pointing at [LICENSE.libsignal](LICENSE.libsignal) for what that means when you redistribute a binary. Where a crate ships no licence file of its own, the canonical text of the licence it declares is supplied in its place, so the file delivers the licences rather than merely naming them. It is deliberately **not** declared under `flutter: assets:`, which would bundle it into every consuming application whether or not it is ever displayed; the README shows how to register it with `LicenseRegistry` for an app that wants it at runtime

#### Security

- **Store durability, write ordering and rollback are now a documented contract** — storage is delegated to the application, and libsignal derives message keys deterministically (the Double Ratchet has no per-message nonce guard), so a store write that is lost to a crash or rolled back by a restore makes the next send reuse a message key and IV. The contract is now stated where implementers read it: on every store interface (`SessionStore`, `IdentityKeyStore`, `PreKeyStore`, `SignedPreKeyStore`, `KyberPreKeyStore`, `SenderKeyStore`), on `SessionCipher` / `SessionBuilder` / `SealedSenderCipher` / `GroupCipher`, and in a new [`SECURITY.md` section](SECURITY.md#store-durability-write-ordering-and-rollback). No behaviour change — the library already awaited every store-write callback before returning a ciphertext or plaintext (verified against the Rust bridge for every entry point); what was missing was the requirement that *your* callback not complete until the write is durable
  - **Durable before release** — a store write must reach stable storage before the operation's output leaves the device or is acted upon, either inside the callback (`fsync`, SQLite `synchronous = FULL`) or via a transaction committed before sending. Deletes and pre-key consumption (`removePreKey`, `markKyberPreKeyUsed`) count as writes
  - **Serialize per address** — corrects the previous guidance in `SECURITY.md` §H, which suggested a lock *inside* the store: that leaves the `load → ratchet → store` window unprotected, so two concurrent `encrypt` calls for one address derive the same message key with no crash involved. The lock must span the whole cipher call
  - **Rollback** — at-rest encryption gives confidentiality, not rollback protection; documents the achievable mitigation (bind the store to a marker in non-backed-up storage and treat a restored copy as a session reset) plus the platform limits of `fsync` on Apple platforms and of IndexedDB durability on the web

- **`SealedSenderCipher.decrypt` now marks the Kyber pre-key it consumed** — it removed the one-time EC pre-key a pre-key message consumed but never called `markKyberPreKeyUsed` for the Kyber pre-key on that same path, so a store that retires marked one-time Kyber pre-keys kept serving one that sealed sender had already consumed. Sealed sender is a normal delivery path for a first message, so this was the ordinary case rather than a corner. Both decryption paths now issue the same four writes

- **Pre-key consumption now reports what libsignal actually did, and `storeSession` is written last** — the bridge inferred `removePreKey` / `markKyberPreKeyUsed` from the fields of the incoming message, while libsignal issues them only when the pre-key message really establishes a new session. A redelivered pre-key message matching an existing session therefore re-consumed keys libsignal had deliberately left alone. The bridge now observes the calls libsignal makes against the stores it is handed. That change requires the session to be persisted **after** the consumption writes (it previously went first): had the order stayed, a crash between the session write and `removePreKey` would let the redelivered message match the persisted session, consume nothing, and leave a one-time pre-key usable forever. The awaited-write table in `SECURITY.md` documents the new order

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **CI verifies the declared MSRV** — `rust-version = "1.88"` in `rust/Cargo.toml` is a promise to anyone building the native library from source, and nothing checked it: the first dependency or language feature to raise the real floor would have broken that build silently, with the failure landing on a contributor rather than here. A new `msrv` job reads the version out of the manifest — rather than repeating it, so the job cannot drift from the claim it checks — installs exactly that toolchain, installs protoc — `spqr`'s prost-based build script shells out to it, so without it the job would fail on tooling rather than on the MSRV it exists to check — and runs `make rust-check`. Verified locally against 1.88 before the job was added; the reusable `setup-rust` action gained a `toolchain` input (default `stable`) to make it possible

- **Reference durable store in `example_cli`** (repository only — `example_cli/` is not part of the published archive) — `lib/stores/durable_file_stores.dart` implements all six stores on an append-only journal that flushes before each write's future completes and replays on open, truncating a torn tail — which, without per-frame checksums, it cannot tell apart from a corrupt header, a limitation the file documents. It ships an `AddressLocks` helper for call-site serialization. `lib/demos/durable_store_demo.dart` proves the round trip: it establishes a session, exchanges messages, closes the stores, reopens them from disk and continues the same conversation. `DurableKyberPreKeyStore` demonstrates both halves of the Kyber contract: a one-time key is retired on its first mark (`loadKyberPreKey` stops serving it), while a last-resort key stays in service and every `(kyberPreKeyId, signedPreKeyId, baseKey)` agreement is journalled, with repeats surfaced through `replayedAgreements`. The demo's final step exercises that second half end to end — it rolls Bob's state back the way a restored backup would, replays the same ciphertext, and shows the identical agreement being marked twice

- **`test/protocol/kyber_pre_key_consumption_test.dart`** — pins the two behaviours that had no coverage: a second pre-key message arriving on the session an earlier one established consumes nothing further, and `SealedSenderCipher.decrypt` marks the Kyber pre-key with the same triple as `SessionCipher.decrypt`

#### Changed

- **`stores-implementation` and `security-review` skills, plus the `CONTRIBUTING.md` review checklist, corrected** — they recommended a lock *inside* the store, which does not cover `load → ratchet → store`, and are now aligned with the durability/serialization contract. Both transaction examples also note that the store's writes must be routed through the ambient transaction (`sqflite` deadlocks if the `db` handle is used inside `db.transaction(...)`)

- **GitHub Actions bumped to their Node 24 majors** — the first grouped Dependabot run moves `actions/checkout` 4 → 7, `actions/upload-artifact` 4 → 7, `actions/download-artifact` 4 → 8, `actions/cache` 4 → 6, `actions/create-github-app-token` 2 → 3, `android-actions/setup-android` 3.2.2 → 4.0.1 and `schneegans/dynamic-badges-action` 1.7.0 → 1.9.0, converging on the pins the copier template now carries. This is catching up to the runner rather than optional drift: CI was already warning that "actions/cache@v4, actions/checkout@v4" target the deprecated Node 20 and "are being forced to run on Node.js 24". Every input these workflows pass still exists on the new majors, and both SHA-pinned actions were verified against their upstream tag refs. The two behaviour changes that do land: `download-artifact` now *fails* a run on a digest mismatch instead of only warning, and `setup-android` dropped its SDK cache (slower Android legs, same output). No workflow logic changed

- **Dependabot branches excluded from the `Signing commit` and `Delete branches` rulesets** — both target `~ALL` branches, so `non_fast_forward` stopped Dependabot from force-pushing a rebase onto a moved `main` and `deletion` stopped it from cleaning up a merged branch: a grouped update PR could never refresh itself once `main` had moved. `refs/heads/dependabot/**/*` is now in each ruleset's `ref_name.exclude` — the trailing `/*` is load-bearing, since a bare `**` does not cross a `/` and so would miss the multi-segment branch names Dependabot actually creates. `main` is unaffected (it is not a Dependabot branch) and keeps `required_signatures` from the same ruleset. Scoped with `exclude` rather than a bypass actor, which on a `~ALL` ruleset would have exempted that actor on `main` too

- **copier template adopted: v3.0.3 → v4.1.0** — the major's single contract change is that every project generate and commit `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` before its next CI run, because `test-reusable.yml` now verifies it; that file and its generator arrive here for the first time (see *For Users* above). Also landing: `make rust-test` and a CI step that runs the crate's own unit tests; `make third-party-notices` / `make verify-third-party-notices`, with `make rust-update` regenerating the inventory so the lockfile and the notices cannot drift apart; the fuzz workflow reads its targets from the `[[bin]]` entries of `rust/fuzz/Cargo.toml` and fans them out one job per target (`fail-fast: false`, per-target crash artefacts) instead of looping over a hardcoded list in a single job that stopped at the first crash — the discovery step was run against `rust/fuzz/Cargo.toml` and yields exactly the six existing targets; `validateUpstreamTag` names which input it rejected, since an API `tag_name`, a `--version` argument and the pin recorded in `rust/Cargo.toml` fail for different reasons; `insertChangelogEntry` matches `#### Changed` exactly, where a prefix match previously also filed a native-library bump under `#### Changed (Breaking)`; the build hook declares a local native build as a dependency, so `make clean` no longer leaves `dart test` pointed at a cached asset that is gone; and `copyright_year` becomes a stored answer, recorded as 2025 — the year of first publication — though for an AGPL-3.0 project it does not reach the rendered `LICENSE`, which the template only stamps for MIT and BSD.
  Three deviations are deliberate. The AI changelog prompt stays this project's own: the template now carries a generic version, while the one here enumerates the crates this wrapper binds and the upstream areas it does not expose, which is what keeps an upstream networking, keytrans or zkgroup change from being announced as a feature of this package. The `freezed_annotation` / `freezed` / `build_runner` dependencies are not adopted — they exist so that a *freshly generated* project's first codegen succeeds against an unknown API surface, whereas this FRB surface has no data-carrying enums, and `freezed_annotation` sits in `dependencies`, so every consumer would download a package nothing here imports. And `ffigen` stays at `^20.1.1` instead of returning to the template's `^20.0.0`.
  The follow-up minor, v4.1.0, landed net-zero: its whole content is this project's own notice-inventory and MSRV work (the two fixes below, plus the reproducibility pass) carried back upstream, so `copier update` had nothing left to apply beyond recording the version

- **The `Signing commit` ruleset no longer bypasses the update GitHub App** — `bypass_actors` is now empty, matching the template. The app's commits are created through the API and are therefore signed by GitHub, so `required_signatures` is satisfied without an exemption, and on a `~ALL` ruleset a bypass actor is exempted everywhere, `main` included — the same reasoning the Dependabot entry above applies. `refs/heads/update-*` is still *not* excluded from the ruleset: the template's policy is to widen `exclude` only on an observed failure, and a failure here is visible rather than silent, since the bot comments on the pull request it could not refresh

#### Fixed

- **The notice inventory no longer depends on the machine that generated it** — `cargo tree --target <triple>` filters *normal* dependencies by that triple but resolves *build*-dependencies for the **host**, so the inventory recorded the build graph of whoever ran the generator rather than of the released targets. Here that is `prost-build` → `tempfile` → `rustix`, whose backend is host-gated: `errno` on a macOS host, `linux-raw-sys` on a Linux one. One crate swapped for the other with the crate count unchanged, so the file generated locally was rejected by the CI check on its first run — correct where it was written, wrong everywhere else, and the check could only report "the contents differ". Nor is the problem confined to build edges: proc-macro subtrees are host-compiled too, which is how `winapi` — reached through `ansi_term` inside a proc-macro crate — stays invisible everywhere except a Windows host. No per-target query escapes this, so the crate set is now taken from `cargo tree --target all`, the only query cargo offers that applies no platform filtering at all; the per-target sweep is kept because it is the one thing that fails when a declared release target stops resolving. Over-attribution is the deliberate trade: the extra entries are build tooling and platform-gated crates that a given build never links — `winapi` here reaches the graph only through a host-compiled proc-macro — but a notice file that lists them on every machine is worth more than a narrower one that changes with the machine, since the byte-exact CI check is only viable if the output is reproducible. Accordingly the inventory grows from 206 to 241 crates, the additions being platform-gated crates and build tooling that were always in the graph but invisible from a macOS host (`linux-raw-sys`, `windows-sys`, `winapi`, `bindgen`, `clang-sys`, …). Cross-checked against `cargo-about`: it now reports no crate this inventory omits. `--check` now also prints the first differing line and the lines unique to each side, since its failure is normally read from a CI log where bisecting a 450 KB file by hand is the only alternative

## [6.1.1] - 2026-07-25

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **libsignal v0.99.1** — internal/dependency update, no public-API impact
- **libsignal_frb v5.1.2** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **libsignal native library → v0.99.1** ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.97.4...v0.99.1))
  - Upstream user-facing changes target the chat/backup/registration services and logging — none of which this library exposes
  - The crates we bind (`libsignal-protocol`, `signal-crypto`, `libsignal-core`) saw internal refactors to track the updated RustCrypto / curve25519-dalek / spqr dependencies, with no change to behaviour or the FFI surface (FRB bindings regenerate byte-for-byte identical)

#### Security

- **Upstream libcrux advisories resolved** — v0.99.1 pulls in `libcrux-sha3` 0.0.10 and `libcrux-secrets` 0.0.6, which fix RUSTSEC-2026-0207, RUSTSEC-2026-0208 (incremental/AVX2 SHAKE) and RUSTSEC-2026-0212 (aarch64 const-time swap). The interim `cargo-audit` / `cargo-deny` suppressions for these three have been removed

## [6.1.0] - 2026-07-21

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **Build provenance attestation (Sigstore, SLSA Build L2)** — every native-release archive is now cryptographically attested to this repository's tag-triggered build, closing the previously documented authenticity gap (verify with `gh attestation verify`)
- **Web: stale-WASM-after-upgrade fixed** — the web build hook now refreshes `web/pkg/` on a version change instead of serving the previous version's WASM, which could crash Dart-store-callback paths (`processPreKeyBundle`, `SessionCipher`, sealed sender, group messaging) after an upgrade
- **Smaller package & explicit minimum OS versions** — the vestigial platform-plugin scaffolding is removed (smaller published archive) and the prebuilt binaries are now built against the documented macOS 10.15 / Android API 24 minimums
- **libsignal v0.97.4** — internal/dependency update, no public-API impact
- **libsignal_frb v5.1.1** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Changed

- **Platform-plugin scaffolding removed from the published package** — the vestigial `ios/`, `macos/`, `android/`, `linux/`, `windows/` directories (podspecs, Gradle project, CMakeLists, plugin stubs) are gone. The package has never declared a `flutter: plugin:` section, so flutter_tools never consumed them; native delivery is (and remains) via the `hook/build.dart` build hook. No consumer action required — the published archive just gets smaller
- **Explicit minimum OS versions for the prebuilt binaries** — CI now builds the macOS dylibs with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: '10.15'` (previously rustc's per-target default, 10.12 for x86_64) and links the Android `.so`s against API level 24 via cargo-ndk `--platform 24` (previously cargo-ndk's default, 21), matching the documented platform-support table
- **libsignal v0.97.4 update** — bump the bound native library ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.97.3...v0.97.4))
  - Upstream changes are limited to `AuthAccountsService` (registration-lock set/clear, discoverable-by-phone-number, registration-recovery-password), `UnauthBackupsService.copyMedia`/`copyBackupMedia`, SVR2 node APIs, and language-binding / bridge tooling (node/java/swift/ts) — none of which this library exposes
  - The only change to the crates we bind (`libsignal-protocol`, `signal-crypto`, `libsignal-core`) is the `libsignal-core` version string (`rust/core/src/version.rs`); `make codegen` produces no binding diff
  - Note: These changes do not affect this library's public API
- **libsignal v0.97.3 update** — bump the bound native library ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.97.2...v0.97.3))
  - Upstream changes are limited to `AuthUsernamesService.deleteUsernameHash()`/`deleteUsernameLink()` (username services), reclassifying an established chat connection's transport errors as retryable (`.ioError`, Swift binding), and increasing the key-transparency clock-skew tolerance interval — none of which this library exposes
  - The crates we bind (`libsignal-protocol`, `signal-crypto`, `libsignal-core`) are unchanged apart from version strings; `make codegen` produces no binding diff
  - Note: These changes do not affect this library's public API

#### Security

- **Build provenance attestation (Sigstore, SLSA Build L2)** — every native-release archive is now attested with GitHub Artifact Attestations: CI signs a provenance statement proving the archive was built by this repository's tag-triggered `build-libsignal.yml` from a specific commit, closing the previously documented authenticity gap (the SHA256 checksums file ships in the same release as the archives). Verify with `gh attestation verify <archive> --repo djx-y-z/libsignal_dart`; a Sigstore bundle (`libsignal_frb-<version>.sigstore.jsonl`) is attached to each release for fully offline verification. See SECURITY.md → Authenticity (the build hook itself still verifies SHA256 only — attestation verification is manual)

#### Fixed

- **Stale web WASM after a package upgrade** — the web build hook (`hook/build.dart`) now records the provisioned crate version in `web/pkg/.wasm-version` and re-downloads when it changes, instead of skipping whenever the two WASM files merely exist. Previously, upgrading the package kept the prior version's WASM in the consuming app's `web/pkg/` (it survives `flutter clean`), so on web any FRB entry that calls Dart store callbacks — `SessionBuilder.processPreKeyBundle`, `SessionCipher`, `SealedSenderCipher`, group messaging — panicked with an argument-count mismatch (`called Option::unwrap() on a None value`) once the wire signature had changed between versions. The download cache is now version-keyed and `rust/Cargo.toml` is a declared web-build dependency, both mirroring the native path (which was unaffected)
- **Build hook download/cache resilience** — the hook (`hook/build.dart`) is more robust against partial/transient failures: a download-cache entry is only reused after a `.download-complete` marker proves the extraction finished (an interrupted `tar` no longer leaves a truncated library that is reused forever), a locally built `rust/target/` library is used only when it matches the target OS **and** architecture (previously a host build could be bundled for a cross-target, e.g. a macOS dylib into an iOS app), the web path no longer fetches checksums when a warm cache can serve the files offline, and both the checksums fetch and the binary download now retry on transient HTTP 5xx/429 instead of failing the build on a single blip

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **`make release-frb` + `release-frb-crate` skill** — one-command native-crate release (stage 1): bumps `rust/Cargo.toml`, stamps the CHANGELOG `libsignal_frb` Highlights line, and creates a signed commit + `libsignal_frb-<version>` tag, pushing to trigger the native build. The commit/tag/push inherit the terminal, so the signing passphrase is entered interactively during the command. Pairs with `release-package` (stage 2)
- **`make release` + updated `release-package` skill** — one-command Dart package release (stage 2) symmetric to `make release-frb`: verifies the stage-1 native binary exists on GitHub Releases, bumps `pubspec.yaml`, finalizes the CHANGELOG (`[Unreleased]` → dated version + a fresh `[Unreleased]` + the bottom compare-link refs), validates with a publish dry-run, then signs a commit + `vX.Y.Z` tag and pushes to trigger the pub.dev publish. The two release commands share git/terminal helpers in `scripts/src/release_common.dart`
- **Repository-protection tooling** — the branch and release-tag rulesets now live in-repo as committed JSON (`.github/rulesets/*.json`, the source of truth), and `make setup-repo-protections` applies them to GitHub via `gh` (idempotent by ruleset name) and configures the `native-build` environment. A new **Protect release tags** ruleset restricts tag creation (all tags) to Admins/Maintainers — covering the release-triggering `libsignal_frb-*` / `v*` and any other — and the native-crate publish (`build-libsignal.yml`) now runs in the required-reviewer `native-build` environment — gating tag-push and `workflow_dispatch` alike, mirroring the `pub.dev` environment that gates pub.dev publishing
- **Dependabot for GitHub Actions** — `.github/dependabot.yml`: weekly grouped update PRs (Monday 06:00 UTC, `chore(deps)` prefix) bump the pinned actions — both the commit SHA and its `# vX.Y.Z` comment — across the workflows and the composite actions (a `directories` glob covers `/.github/actions/*`, since `/` only scans `.github/workflows/`). `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` is ignored: it has no versioned releases (master-SHA pin, toolchain selected via input) and stays manually bumped

#### Changed

- **Accept unremediable upstream libcrux crypto advisories in cargo-deny / cargo-audit** — three RustSec advisories published 2026-07-17 (`RUSTSEC-2026-0207` / `-0208`, incorrect / panicking SHAKE in `libcrux-sha3` 0.0.8; `RUSTSEC-2026-0212`, incorrect aarch64 constant-time swap in `libcrux-secrets` 0.0.5) live in libsignal's git-pinned ML-KEM stack and are not fixable from this repo — the fix requires a libsignal release that bumps `libcrux-ml-kem` (v0.97.4 still ships the old libcrux). Added to `rust/deny.toml` `[advisories].ignore` and the `rust-audit` `--ignore` flags as a tracked interim suppression so the `cargo-deny` / `cargo-audit` CI jobs pass — to be removed once a fixed libsignal release lands
- **Decoupled the `libsignal_frb` native release from libsignal dependency updates** — automated update PRs no longer bump the crate version or build binaries; dependency updates accumulate on `main` (tested from source in CI), and the native build is now triggered by pushing a `libsignal_frb-<version>` tag instead of by pushing to `main`. The crate-version bump is now a deliberate release decision (`make release-frb`). See CLAUDE.md → Release Flow
- **AI changelog generator classifies upstream changes against the bound-crate surface** — the prompt now states which crates/APIs this wrapper actually binds, so out-of-scope upstream changes (net / chat / keytrans / username services / zkgroup / …) are framed as "none of which this library exposes", and it links to a version `compare` instead of the (often incomplete) release notes
- **CI enforces deployment-target consistency** — `test-reusable.yml` now runs `make check-targets` (Linux leg) so the build fails if the iOS / macOS / Android minimum deployment targets drift out of sync across the CI build env vars, the example Xcode projects and the README platform table. Previously the check existed (`make check-targets`) but was never run automatically
- **Deployment-target sources consolidated** — `.copier-answers.yml` remains the single source of truth; with the platform scaffolding removed, `make check-targets` and `scripts/get_android_min_sdk.dart` no longer read the podspecs/`build.gradle` but verify the CI workflow (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, cargo-ndk `--platform`) instead
- **Upstream tag names validated before reaching the shell** — `check_updates.dart` / `check_template_updates.dart` reject a release `tag_name` that is not a plain semver-ish tag before it lands in `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and the update workflows pass step outputs/inputs into `run:` blocks via `env:` instead of inline `${{ }}` interpolation — closing a shell-injection path from upstream release names (backport of the liboqs audit)
- **Least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` everywhere** — `publish.yml` and `build-libsignal.yml` now default to `contents: read` with job-level opt-ups (`id-token: write` on the pub.dev publish job, `contents: write` on the release jobs); the two update-checker workflows drop `contents/pull-requests: write` entirely (all writes go through the App token)
- **Third-party actions pinned to commit SHAs** — `dart-lang/setup-dart`, `peter-evans/create-pull-request`, `android-actions/setup-android`, `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd`, `schneegans/dynamic-badges-action`, `Swatinem/rust-cache`, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` (toolchain now passed via the `toolchain` input since the ref no longer selects it)
- **`setup-make` verifies gnumake.exe by SHA256** — release assets are mutable, so the size check alone did not lock the Windows make binary; a hardcoded SHA256 (updated together with the version) now does
- **Pre-release hardening pass (audit fixes)** — a review of this cycle's changes fixed, among others: `make release-frb` now syncs and stages `rust/Cargo.lock` alongside `rust/Cargo.toml` (the pre-commit `cargo check` no longer leaves a dirty tree that blocked stage 2, and the signed tag no longer carries a stale lock); `Swatinem/rust-cache` is repinned from the floating `v2` tag object to the real `v2.9.1` commit (would have broken every Rust job when upstream re-tagged `v2`); the pub.dev release notes are written via `--notes-file` instead of an inline heredoc (a literal `EOF` line in the changelog can no longer break out into the shell); `build-libsignal.yml` no longer delete-then-recreates a release (fail-loud, no silent clobber) and the release-existence probe fails closed on API errors; the `fuzz.yml` dispatch `duration` input is validated and passed via `env:`; `make check-targets` fails closed when a checked file/pattern disappears; and `--date` in `make release` is validated. Docs corrected across README/CLAUDE/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/rulesets (build-hook fallback, `AI_MODELS_TOKEN`, two-stage publishing, `.skip_*_hook` semantics, stale Cargokit/loading-order references)
- **Adopt copier template v3.0.0** — most of this template release (the two-stage release flow, repository rulesets, Dependabot, and the CI deployment-target check) was already backported into this repo, so the update reduced to a documentation and tooling sync: `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains the "Releasing (two stages)" and "Repository rulesets & tag protection" sections, and the `Makefile` `.PHONY` list is reordered to match the template (no behavior change)

## [6.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **Identity-trust enforcement (breaking)** — a remote identity key that differs from the stored one is now rejected with `UntrustedIdentity` on every session operation (MITM / safety-number-change detection), instead of being silently accepted
- **Hardened supply chain & binary** — the native-binary download is now fail-closed (aborts if it can't be verified), and the wrapper crate is built with integer-overflow checks
- **App store additional permission** — the license now allows AGPL-compliant apps to ship through app stores with AGPL-incompatible terms (e.g. the Apple App Store); see `LICENSE.appstore`
- **libsignal v0.97.2** — internal/dependency update, no public-API impact
- **libsignal_frb v5.0.0 (internal Rust FFI crate)** — breaking (major): adds a required `get_identity` callback

#### Changed (Breaking)

- **Identity-trust is now enforced on every session operation**, matching upstream libsignal's `is_trusted_identity` semantics. `SessionBuilder.processPreKeyBundle`, `SessionCipher.encrypt`/`decrypt` (both pre-key and regular Whisper messages), and `SealedSenderCipher.encrypt`/`decrypt` now consult your `IdentityKeyStore.getIdentity` and reject a remote identity key that differs from the stored one with an `UntrustedIdentity` error. Previously a substituted identity (e.g. from a malicious key-distribution server) was accepted without error. First contact is still trusted-on-first-use.
  - **Action required:** catch `UntrustedIdentity` (its message contains `untrusted identity`) and treat it as a safety-number change — verify with the user, then save the new identity (or clear the old one) in your store and archive the old session for that address before retrying. Requires your `IdentityKeyStore.getIdentity` to be implemented correctly.

#### Changed

- Update libsignal native library to v0.97.2 ([compare](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/compare/v0.96.4...v0.97.2))
  - Upstream changes between v0.96.4 and v0.97.2 are limited to net/registration, chat/backups gRPC, bridge/codegen tooling, and CI / language-binding (node/swift/java) updates — none of which this library exposes
  - The only diffs in the crates we bind are cosmetic: a test-only import in `kem.rs`, an internal `TryFrom` refactor in `state/bundle.rs` (`and_then(…map…)` → `.zip(…)`, behavior identical), and the `libsignal-core` version string
  - Note: These changes do not affect this library's public API
- **App store additional permission (AGPL §7)** — the package license now carries an explicit app-store exception (the Feeel/wger wording, see `LICENSE.appstore`): GPL/AGPL-compliant applications may distribute this package in object-code form through app stores whose terms are incompatible with the AGPL (such as the Apple App Store), provided their source stays available under the AGPL through an unrestricted channel. The permission covers only this repository's code; the status of an equivalent permission for the bundled upstream `libsignal` is tracked in [signalapp/libsignal#684](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/issues/684). Requested in [#44](https://github.com/djx-y-z/libsignal_dart/issues/44)

#### Security

- **Fail-closed native library verification** — the build hook (`hook/build.dart`) now aborts the build if the SHA256 checksums for a downloaded binary cannot be fetched or the archive has no entry, instead of silently proceeding unverified. An escape hatch (`LIBSIGNAL_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_DOWNLOAD=1`) remains for releases with no checksums file
- **Hardened crate build** — the wrapper's release profile enables `overflow-checks`, so an integer overflow in the wrapper is a deterministic (catchable) panic rather than silent wraparound (the audited crypto dependencies are left untouched)
- **Secret-lifetime & zeroing caveats documented** — `SECURITY.md` now spells out that opaque secret handles (`PrivateKey`, `KyberSecretKey`, `SessionRecord`, …) stay resident in native memory until a non-deterministic GC finalizer runs, so security-critical code should call `dispose()` to bound that window (noting the extractable key types are `Copy`/plain-boxed and thus not zeroized on drop — `dispose()` shortens the exposure window, it does not wipe), and that Rust's `zeroize` covers Rust memory only: secret bytes that cross the FFI boundary into a Dart `Uint8List` live on the un-zeroed GC heap where `SecureBytes`/`zeroize()` are best-effort. `PrivateKey.cloneKey()` / `KyberSecretKey.cloneKey()` now carry a `# Security` doc note that each copy is an independent secret

#### Fixed

- **Device ID truncation** — the `ProtocolAddress` and `PreKeyBundle` constructors no longer truncate the `u32` device ID to `u8` before validating (e.g. `257` is no longer accepted as device `1`); out-of-range IDs are rejected as documented (1–127)
- **HKDF output bound** — `hkdfDerive` now rejects an output length above the RFC 5869 maximum (`255 × 32 = 8160` bytes) before allocating, instead of attempting an oversized allocation
- **In-memory identity-store equality** — `InMemoryIdentityKeyStore` now compares identity keys by value (`equals()`) rather than by object reference, so a re-presented key is correctly seen as unchanged (matters for production stores copied from this reference implementation)
- **Native-library download cache key** — the build hook (`hook/build.dart`) now keys its download cache by crate version and the full platform variant (e.g. `ios-device-arm64` vs `ios-simulator-arm64`) rather than only OS + architecture. On Apple-silicon hosts iOS device and simulator builds shared a key, so whichever built first poisoned the cache for the other and `dyld` rejected the bundled library at runtime (`incompatible platform: have 'iOS-simulator', need 'iOS'`); a version bump could also serve a stale cached binary

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **Fuzzing harness** — `cargo-fuzz` targets (`rust/fuzz/`) covering every byte-parsing entry point (keys, messages, records, sealed-sender certificates, crypto primitives, pre-key decryption), a seed-corpus generator, and a `Fuzz` CI workflow (per-PR smoke run + weekly deep run). See `make fuzz-list` / `make fuzz`
- **Dependency policy** — `cargo-deny` (`rust/deny.toml`, `make rust-deny`, CI `deny` job) enforcing RustSec advisories, an AGPL-compatible license allow-list, and a source allow-list restricted to crates.io and the official Signal repositories
- **Rust linting (Clippy)** — `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` now runs in CI (the reusable test workflow, on the Linux x86_64 leg) and locally via `make rust-clippy`; the hand-written wrapper is lint-clean, with the FRB-inherent lints (many-callback store signatures, complex tuple returns) annotated with justified site-local `#[allow]`s

#### Changed

- **CI least-privilege** — the reusable test workflow now declares `permissions: contents: read`
- **Rust lint** — hand-written Rust is compiled with `unsafe_code = "deny"` (only the FRB-generated bridge is exempt)
- **Copier template adopted (v2.5.1)** — `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` is now pinned via `make setup-frb-codegen` (kept in sync with the `flutter_rust_bridge` dependency, `2.12.0`); the libsignal-update workflow installs the codegen binary (fixing a codegen step that failed with exit 127) and skips regenerating an update PR that already exists; `check_updates.dart` bumps the wrapper crate version mirroring the upstream SemVer delta, `update_changelog.dart` classifies update severity via AI, and the `update-libsignal` skill now analyzes the full upstream diff
