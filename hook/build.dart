/// Build hook for downloading and bundling libsignal native libraries.
///
/// This hook is automatically invoked by the Dart/Flutter build system
/// when building applications that depend on the libsignal package.
///
/// The hook downloads pre-built native libraries from GitHub Releases
/// based on the target platform and architecture.
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// ### Native platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows)
/// 1. Hook downloads the appropriate `libsignal_frb` binary for the target
/// 2. Registers it as a CodeAsset with asset ID `package:libsignal/libsignal`
/// 3. Dart runtime bundles and loads the asset automatically
///
/// ### Web platform
/// 1. Hook detects web build (no code_assets config)
/// 2. Downloads WASM files to `<app_root>/web/pkg/`
/// 3. FRB loads WASM at runtime from that location
///
/// ## For development
///
/// A locally built library is picked up automatically — no marker needed. The
/// hook prefers a host-matching `rust/target/` build over downloading:
/// ```bash
/// # Native platforms → rust/target/release/lib<crate>.<ext>
/// make build
///
/// # Web/WASM → rust/target/wasm32/
/// make build-web
/// ```
///
/// `.skip_libsignal_hook` is an INTERNAL escape used by the Makefile while it
/// wraps pub-get/codegen/doc: when present the hook returns immediately and
/// registers NO native asset. It is not the way to select a local build.
